I operate in a cross-functional role dedicated to the design of software and hardware for the Axiom Cloud. The Axiom Cloud equips commercial refrigeration systems with a digital data and control layer, bringing an inflexible and critical aspect of the food chain into the digital age. Refrigeration systems equipped with the Axiom Cloud benefit from data analytics and fleet-level coordination resulting in improved operations (through reduced downtime, predictive maintenance, etc.), optimized utility bills resulting in immediate return on investment, and mitigated direct and indirect carbon emissions.

I have designed and developed:

- software that systematically builds a digital-twin model of refrigeration systems' complex and varied configurations
- real-time control systems.
- subsystem architecture, applying hardware to solve problems in new application of refrigeration technology.
- thermal models and their implementation in software.
- electrical panels and power systems.
- project management and deployment frameworks

Description:
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are increasingly being used to automate decision-making in many sectors within international development. Although computer intelligence is continuously improving, it has been shown that improper implementation of these algorithms can lead to strong bias, unfairness, or exclusion of certain groups. 

This research project will help determine guidelines of ethical use of machine learning in developing countries, developing a framework of use of machine learning with criteria of fairness and appropriate use, discovering partnerships in industry, academia, or government in developing countries, and building capacity through educational materials and datasets shared with the world at the end of the research. Integral to this effort are case studies of several sites abroad and in the US which focus on different aspects of applications of machine learning, from employment, to medicine, education, lending, devices, to name a few.

The output of this research will include a framework for appropriate and ethical use of machine learning methods based on the interdisciplinary case studies, data analyses, meta-analyses, and pedagogical materials which can be integrated into future machine learning courses around the world. Learning from and collaborating with partners applying machine learning in emerging economies are essential guiding principles for this work.

Some questions I have tackled include how a VC firm's premature withdrawal from VC syndicates affects future deal flow; whether VC firms help the fundraising activities of their syndication partners; and under what conditions lower-status VC firms can work with higher-status VC firms.

Jordan Thomas,"I am a 2018 graduate of Princeton University with a concentration in Public and International Affairs and dual certificates in Portuguese Language and Culture and in African American Studies. At Princeton, I focused my academic coursework on poverty, inequality, and social mobility. I am particularly interested in the role that law, public policy, and high-quality education play in expanding access and opportunity for disadvantaged populations. I also have a strong interest in impact investment, urban economic development, and the ways in which the power of capital can be harnessed for social good.As one of 32 American students selected from a pool of over 2,500 applicants to receive a 2018 Rhodes Scholarship – the first Rhodes Scholar in the history of the Newark Public Schools system – I completed a Master's degree in Evidence-Based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation at the University of Oxford. Subsequently, I reaffirmed my commitment to purpose-driven, tri-sector leadership by spearheading various impact initiatives as Chief of Staff to philanthropist Ray Chambers; as Advisor to the GreenLight Fund in Baltimore and Newark; as Project Manager of the Newark COVID-19 Response Taskforce’s Testing Subcommittee; and as a Board Member of the Portuguese American Leadership Council of the United States (PALCUS). I also remained a devoted mentor, college and postgraduate advisor, and community volunteer. I am currently working as an SEO Law Fellow in the New York office of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP before enrolling at both Yale Law School and Harvard Business School for a unique JD/MBA dual degree between the two institutions. Ultimately, I intend to engage in work that most directly promotes equal opportunity, social mobility, and justice for all.","SEO Law Fellow

Aeshna Prasad,"An urban designer-planner, researcher, and architect by profession, Aeshna Prasad is deeply passionate and committed to addressing questions of urban resilience, sustainable development, and social equity – primarily through the lenses of affordable housing, infrastructure, critical conservation, and climate adaptation. She is currently in the final semester of her dual-degree program at Harvard GSD in the Master of Architecture in Urban Design and Master of Design Studies, Ecologies domain. Her keen interest in public space, incremental-affordable housing, and infrastructures of resilience has led her to continuously approach design as a tool for negotiation, experimentation & transformation. She is extremely interested in tackling contemporary urban challenges brought on by rapid urbanization, economic and political transitions, which lead to contested landscapes.Academically and professionally, Aeshna continues to engage with these subjects through her work as a teaching & research associate with professors like Rahul Mehrotra, David Gamble, Antione Picon, and Abby Spinak; courtesy numerous grants and awards she has received from institutions such as the Joint Center of Housing Studies and the Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute at Harvard; and via her work at the Harvard Innovation Lab where she incubated her social-impact venture ‘Sahayak' - an integrated mapping platform aimed at tackling mass-migration. Aeshna has also pursued numerous internships, most recently at Robert A.M Stern Architects, and full-time work with reputed Indian design studios before her master’s studies.In addition to urban planning and design, she is deeply interested in international development, policy, and advocacy. In line with this, her work has been spread across diverse geographies such as Mumbai, Cape Town, New York, Boston, and Colombia. She has also taken classes in Strategy, Leadership, Advanced Negotiation and Conflict Resolution. This she believes will help her manage, finance, and implement projects moving forward. Apart from her professional and academic pursuits, Aeshna has broadened her outlook and perspectives through various leadership positions and extra-curricular activities. She has served as Harvard Graduate Council Chair and Diversity and Inclusion Chair in the Student Forum, as co-chair of South Asia GSD, and as the editor of the Urban Design Department’s publication platform UD:ID. Armed with a multi-disciplinary skillset and multi-scalar design sensibilities, Aeshna is now looking for full-time job opportunities in urban design & planning.","Harvard University Graduate School of Design

Caribbean
Big Leaf Capital exists to develop the Caribbean Carbon Removal economy. Establishing pathways in lockstep with underfunded environmental project developers, eager buyers, and investors who want to do good and well provides a unique case study in unlocking the Caribbean’s economic potential by focusing on its natural capital. We aim to off take high-quality carbon removal credits from project developers, be they risk capital-backed entrepreneurs or existing conservation groups, with the flexibility of structure to allow the project to scale and deliver material amounts of carbon credits at a discount to Big Leaf Capital. 

This is a triple win: a win for local groups, a win for investors who already understand the potential of carbon credits, and a win for the environment. Not only does this provide a way to restore the environment, but by centering the investments in the local community, we are creating new, regenerative livelihoods. Profit-sharing agreements with local shareholders empower them to fund and self-fund context-specific solutions. In doing so, we will make the Caribbean synonymous with the carbon removal economy.

Teaching Assistant for Design Thinking @ Williams
Sep 2017 - Jun 2019 · 1 yr 10 mos
DesignThinking@Williams offers techniques for solving social, cultural, and economic problems using creative thinking and human centered design. 

These tools can:

-Assist faculty in their teaching objectives; 

-Empower students in their social and entrepreneurial endeavors;

-Assist the College as it continually improves the Williams experience; and prepare students to use the strength of their liberal arts education in purposeful ways in the work environment;

This approach to problem solving is used  in start-ups, consumer-facing businesses, non-profits committed to social change, and government agencies seeking ways to improve the citizen experience

As a TA we help students:

-Build creative confidence

-Take risks to allow innovative solutions

-Test many different ideas

-Learn from failure 

-Craft solutions focused on the human experience. 

Design thinking involves a series of steps that encourage creative inquiry, such as always indulging in divergent thinking—testing the bounds of reasonable options—before converging on a possible solution; team work that respects the kind of diversity of educational experience gained in a liberal arts college; and focusing on the opportunity for solutions to benefit people, not institutions, policies, or models.

--

JustMoney approaches money as a legal project. Created to meet demands both public and private, money depends on law for its definition, issue, and operation. That legal structure of money – its design – matters deeply. The website's aim is to encourage discussion, debate, and scholarship on money’s design and its reform towards a world that is as just as it is (economically) productive.

Despite the centrality of money’s design, it is marginalized as a public and academic concern. Most leave it to economists to explain. Economists do so according to disciplinary terms. Those terms set aside issues of money’s legal definition, creation, and change over time.  Banking and financial regulation scholars target the architecture of the current system, but an enormous territory remains outside those fields. JustMoney's contributors are interested in questions such as how:

• Societies configure governance as they build a sovereign unit of account
• Strategies to delegate credit creation to private financial institutions implicate democratic legitimacy
• The phenomena of instability and inequality relate to decisions about monetary design
• Public support in the figure of the payments system can perform both political and technical values

Those issues engage fields like constitutional law, civil rights, poverty law, and legal theory just as directly as fields defined as monetary or financial.  More generally, the issues the website hopes to raise cross disciplinary bounds to history, sociology, political science, anthropology, and the humanities, as well as economics.

2018 - 2023
Grade: Secondary in Economics. Citations in Arabic (MSA) and Chinese (Mandarin)
Activities and societies: Lightweight Crew, Harvard College Opera, Harvard Model United Nations, Satire V, Arab Conference at Harvard; Student Ambassador for Morgan Stanley
Custom path of study combines economics, comparative law/legal history (via cross-enrollment at Harvard Law School), and other social sciences (sociology, government, history, etc.) and history of thought to build an integrated study of political economy studying both the activities of economic agents and the institution- and belief-structures that organize those activities. 

Used above, ""institutions"" includes not just macro-level governance (regulators, central banks, IMF, unions) and policy regimes (fiscal policy; antitrust, competition, labor, price regulation; etc.), but also the designs of basic ""background"" arrangements setting terms of economic interaction: contracts, property, money, corporate forms, etc. (This is distinct from ""law and economics"" and ""institutional/political economics,"" which use economics to analyze law/institutions, because it begins from institutional indeterminacy, analyzes institutions via law and design thinking, and tracks consequences via economics.)
A.M. (Concurrent), Regional Studies - East Asia (China Social Sciences)
2021 - 2023
Studying political economy of contemporary China. Planned thesis explores financing in China’s emerging knowledge economy, focusing on legal-institutional factors structuring the growth of its indigenous startup and venture capital industries. 

Thesis will compare and contrast details of the Chinese and American institutional solutions to the ""simultaneity problems"" of fostering a venture capital sector and chart how different designs that address the same institutionally indeterminate functions yield different market dynamics, focusing on structural impacts on a) the direction of innovation, b) channels of access to vanguardist sectors, c) the pace and effectiveness of disruptive innovation regulatory response, and, relatedly, d) market and extra-market mechanisms of firm competition pressure. 

Thesis is part of a larger argument about the nature of China's and all market economies: ""capitalist,"" ""socialist,"" ""mixed economy""? Or does a deeper indeterminacy belie those categories?
