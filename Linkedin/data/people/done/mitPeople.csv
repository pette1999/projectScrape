I am a coauthor on a paper studying the impact of artificial intelligence on US hiring from 2010 onwards. We use establishment level data on vacancies with detailed occupational information comprising the near-universe of online vacancies in the US. We classify establishments as AI exposed, that is, likely to replace workers with AI based on their detailed skill mix garnered from their job postings in 2010. We then study how AI exposure affects overall hiring and hiring composition.

My master's thesis is augmenting the 1940 US census with more detailed information about the work done by each person in the labor force. The purpose of this project is to study the nature of new work in 1940. I use a BERT model to predict each person's job complexity based on the job's textual description in the 1939 Dictionary of Occupational Titles. The trained model achieves an accuracy of 80% in the classification task and is able to predict job complexity for earlier and later years.

We are studying fear extinction by exploring the formation of new
memories on every level of neuroscience; from genes to neurons to behavior. We hope to find a correlation between the formation and extinction of fear memories and the neuronal circuitry associated with these memories. For example, introducing a conditioned stimulus without the associated unconditioned stimulus will create new memories and new neuronal circuits will be recruited that will contradict the previous, fearful memories. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the discovery of new therapies for anxiety-type disorders and other psychiatric diseases.

I developed a video analysis protocol to pair with a compression machine to collect force and percent deformation data.  Using this compression test and video analysis technique, I characterized the viscoelasticity of bacteria granules collected from both standard and experimental water treatment systems, to help understand the stress they can sustain in a treatment system while still remaining effective.  I also created computer model of a granule to demonstrate the viscoelastic property of the granules in contrast to an elastic property via COMSOL Multiphysics.

6.004 Lab Assistant
Sep 2015 - May 2017 · 1 yr 9 mos
In this course, I guided and taught students to write code and design circuits for digital systems. The majority of the coursework comes from labs, which I was responsible for helping students debug and receive credit for. The labs begin with MOS transistors and logic gates and progresses through increasingly complicated digital systems, the highlight of which is the fully operational gate-level design of an RISC processor (a.k.a. ""The Beta""). Other lab assignments include a Tiny OS, an ALU, a Turing machine algorithm for checking if a string of parentheses is balanced, and Quicksort written in a low-level language specifically for the course adapted from x86 Assembly.

6.149 Lab Assistant
Jan 2016 · 1 mo
I guide and teach students with little to no programming experience in writing, testing, and debugging Python software. Students start with types and simple arithmetic and progress through programming concepts in Python during the course, culminating in basic object-oriented programming and inheritance. Some of the programs built include a game of Hangman (including an ASCII stick figure), a game of Battleship using Python's graphics library, and a game of Scrabble.
In addition, this position required me to proofread problem sets, labs, and exams before they are assigned to the students. I also had to grade exams given to the students.
6.117 Lab Assistant
I guide and teach students with little to no experience with electrical engineering and circuits to read schematics, use lab equipment, and build circuits from scratch. The students learn how to use oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, multimeters, function generators, soldering kits, and other tools. Some of the circuits built include an ECG amplifier and a USB powered audio amplifier.

I guided students through the software and design labs throughout the course. The software labs consisted of writing Python software that either extends the last homework assignment or will be used later on in the design lab that week. The design labs forced the students to use the concepts learned that week in the context of robotics, e.g. getting a robot to follow a light using an analog circuit, getting a robot to make it from one point in a maze to another using basic search algorithms, designing an optimal impulse response for the robot's change in speed and direction, etc. My job specifically was to give checkoffs, hold office hours, and help students debug their work.

Engineering Intern
Mellanox Technologies
Jun 2015 - Aug 2015 · 3 mos
Yoqneam, Israel
One of Mellanox's major products is switch boards for communication between supercomputers. High speed communication links/cables are used to connect the ports on the switches so that packets of data can be sent back and forth between the switches. Of course, because these links are imperfect copper cables, the information packets get corrupted as they travels through the link. My job as an intern on this team was to fix this problem so that the information would be as correct and uncorrupted as possible.
I first had to design error correction and cancellation filters for the high speed links. This involved researching different types of filters for error correction, figuring out how to model the impulse response of the links (i.e. mathematically represent the corruption), and choosing the best filter coefficients according to my model. I used Matlab to confirm my ideal filters and to select these coefficients by writing search algorithms that optimized the coefficient values according to data that had been sampled from the links. Finally, I tested and revised my designs using the firmware API belonging to a testing switchboard.

High school students who are looking to improve their scores on the SAT and SAT Subject Tests signed up for this program during the fall and spring semesters. I lectured weekly on the Math section, the Writing section, and test-taking in general.
For the Math section, I focused on teaching the students how to problem solve, since they had already learned enough math to complete the exam. For the Writing section, I focused on teaching the students how to hear when grammar in a sentence sounds wrong (multiple choice section) and how to write a concise, smart essay in under 30 minutes (essay section). In both classes, I also spent time teaching the students how to improve their ability to find the right answer in the event that they're dumbfounded by showing them patterns in how the test-makers write the exams.
Undergraduate Student Researcher (UROP)
May 2014 - Aug 2014 · 4 mos
MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory
My supervisor at the lab was developing the shape and configuration of a neutron detector that, when neutrons were shot at it, produced an image indicating where the neutrons landed. My job was to figure out the optimal geometry and positioning of the detector for the project.

The simulation of shooting neutrons had already been written by someone else using C/C++. I had to sift through the code, figure out how it worked, and use this simulation to mathematically model where the neutrons were landing, how the positioning of the detector affected the neutrons' landing positions, and what the detector's 3D shape should be (ultimately a combination of 3D conic sections). I used Python to write simulations to optimize all of this.

Certified Adversarial Robustness for Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep Neural networks, used in commercially available driver assistance systems, can fail on hardly detectable adversaries, for example, white stickers on the road. This work has invented an add-on, real-time defense algorithm to certify the robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to such adversaries. Patent pending.
Safe Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty Estimates
Deep neural networks can fail overconfidently on novel observations, for example, an uncollaborative pedestrian on a personal vehicle. This work pioneers a reinforcement learning framework that detects novel observations and cautiously avoids them by reasoning about the neural network's predictive confidence.

Machine Learning-based Estimation of Forest Carbon Stocks to increase Transparency of Forest Preservation Efforts
Efforts to maintain and restore rainforest, one of the cheapest carbon sinks, are limited by the amount of funding. This work creates deep-learning-based forest inventories from drone imagery, collected by locals, to cheaply and accurately estimate the amount of tree-sequestered carbon. The transparent estimation of carbon attracts funding from companies, aiming for carbon neutrality, and allows locals to generate a livelihood from maintaining and rebuilding rainforest.

Fadok Richard,"As a cultural anthropologist, I study how contemporary architects and industrial designers in the United States are rethinking their most fundamental assumptions about the nature of design in the midst of the ongoing environmental crises of the Anthropocene. My interdisciplinary scholarship spans across the anthropology of science and technology (or STS), design studies, and the environmental humanities. My dissertation uses historical and ethnographic methods to inspect a multi-disciplinary design practice known as biomimicry. My forthcoming project will ask how architects think about and design for animals. I am currently a PhD candidate in the History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society Program at MIT. I have my M.Sc. in Biomedicine, Bioscience, and Society from the London School of Economics and an Sc.B. with honors in Neuroscience and Science and Society from Brown University.My previous research projects have explored the life sciences, including microbiology and neuroscience.

Ian Bouche,"Hi! I'm Ian, and I'm thrilled to enter the professional sphere at a time when so much technology seems at the cusp of profound revolution. I insist on using my skillset to change big things about the world. I have a passion for figuring out how things work. That's why I'm seeking to understand a new 'big' system, and be put into a position where I can tackle multidimensional problems pertaining to it. Be it a budget, a microchip, a city or a rocket, if its deep and complicated, I'm interested.I have significant experience with electronics which I've been able to apply both as a hobbyist and as a researcher. Working with Prof. Wolfgang Ketterle at his lab in MIT, I built electronic frameworks to optimize the extremely precise optical systems required to create Bose-Einstein condensates, even reverse-engineering the communication protocols that certain lab equipment used to send custom RS-232 commands without the expensive conversion tool.Currently I am a part of Prof. Kerstin Perez research group at MIT, in which I have had a broad host of experiences. For one, I worked on the silicon-lithium (Si(Li)) semiconductor detector array inside the General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS). GAPS is a balloon-borne experiment designed to test dark matter models by measuring cosmic antideuteron flux at low energies. Partaking in this hunt for antiparticles has taught me innumerable skills, among them experimental design, electrical engineering, particle physics theory, data analysis through ROOT (C++) and python, semiconductor theory and fabrication, and effective communication and teamwork with peers in the lab and the international GAPS team. My work with GAPS began when I was an undergraduate, first focusing on programming Monte Carlo simulations of GAPS using the GEANT4 simulation framework, built on CERN’s ROOT data analysis software for C++. Since September 2021, employed as a full-time researcher at the Perez lab, I have been working more directly with the Si(Li) detectors, testing their performance and troubleshooting the delicate electronics. Most recently, I’ve been involved in fabricating additional Si(Li) semiconductor detectors for GAPS in the MIT Nano facility by etching, cutting, and evaporating lithium onto the p-type silicon material at high temperatures.I'm looking to the future with my varied past in mind, and open to a wide range of opportunities. If you're interested in my profile for whatever reason, send me a message!","Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Our lab studies Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) that control upper-limb prostheses. In particular, we are interested in how the brain controls complex hand movements. The human hand has about 30 dimensions in contrast to a human arm with only 7 dimensions. BMIs that control human arms have already been demonstrated with decent accuracies. What type of interface is needed to extend the control from 7 to 37 dimensions forms the central topic of research of the lab.

Energy Efficiency Engineer (Analyst)
Sep 2014 - Apr 2016 · 1 yr 8 mos
As an analyst-level Energy Efficiency Engineer within Cadmus, I worked on a variety of projects within the Engineering Services Division.

-I was a crucial team member in a program evaluation of Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps across Massacusetts and Rhode Island. As a principal member of the team, I was involved in the process from deployment to collection to reporting. The resulting report is groundbreaking in that it established performance models in a variety of conditions and across 250 different heat pumps.

-During the winter of 2014-2015, I designed and performed a technical demonstration of Heat Pump Clothes Dryers for a Massachusetts client. The demonstration isolated the impact on energy use, drying duration, and overall performance based on modifications to individual set points of the unit. The final report which I authored conveyed the implications of behavior in the expected energy savings of the units, as well as outlined conditions under which energy savings were negated. Several non-energy benefits were also reviewed during the scope of the study and quantified to illustrate the implications of different drying technologies.

-As part of the Evaluation, Measurement, and Verification team, I performed dozens of project reviews across several states and a variety of building purposes. I focused mainly in the HVAC components; notably boilers, roof top units, steam traps, variable air volume systems, digital direct control (DDC) systems, building shell improvements, and lighting.

I collaborate with the FAA to investigate and develop cutting-edge emission reduction technologies for gas turbine engines. Our goal is to develop solutions that would mitigate the environmental impacts of aviation without compromising engine performance. 

I worked in a 7-member team to evaluate the effectiveness of using novel water injection technology in different parts of an aircraft engine. I analyzed the gas turbine engine cycle and optimized the trade-off between engine performance and emissions using this approach. Our research showed that this method yields up to an 80% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.

Additionally, I designed and sized a fuel tank to store cryogenic liquid hydrogen inside an aircraft’s fuselage. This involved working in a 12-member team. I conducted stress, material, and pressure vessel analysis to come up with a design that is the most weight-efficient for the aircraft. Our efforts furthered research in this new area and we determined that this method can help bring the aviation industry close to the goal of zero emissions.

I rotated between the Sales, Manufacturing, and Design departments. I oversaw manufacturing operations of centrifugal pumps and worked in a 5-member team to improve pump efficiency and product designs. 

My team was tasked with improving pump efficiency by 2%. After studying the product design and conducting testing, we recommended that the company change the impeller blade curvature. Furthermore, to streamline this change process, we advised that the company use the mold of a previous model’s impeller blade. 

As a result, a +3% improvement was seen in pump efficiency and the project timeline was halved to 3 months.

Stephen O'Sullivan,"Understanding the properties and behavior of black holes in an astrophysical environment is of utmost importance to improving their detection and observability. During my PhD work, motivated by this premise, I concentrated on examining the response of a black hole due to the gravitational influence of an orbiting body. This process combined tools from differential geometry, calculus and numerical computing to produce animations of black hole event horizons using the Mayavi data visualization package. The result illustrates the fluid dynamics behavior of the horizon albeit with a negative viscosity. I was also involved in a collaboration which focussed on modeling the complexities of a black hole binary inspiral. We did so by analyzing the signals from a time-domain numerical simulation and mapping them to an analytical formalism.As a physicist in training, I enjoy problem-solving, numerical analysis and large-scale cloud computing. In my spare time, I like to hone my maths and programming skills by solving Euler problems and participating in TopCoder marathons. I am also excited by real-world problems involving geometry and graph analysis.","Principal Software Engineer

As part of my capstone project for my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering, I developed a multi-objective optimization workflow for early conceptual design of tall buildings with the Rhinoceros 3D modelling environment. This project involved a parametrically controlled model of a generic building geometry which was optimized (using the NSGA-II algorithm) with regards to structural, operational energy, and daylight autonomy performance. The findings of the project reveal that conceptual design and building performance can be used simultaneously to produce high performing, aesthetically interesting designs that are highly climate specific.

Analysis of Masonry Structures: Dome at Soltaniyeh
- As part of my undergraduate curriculum, this intensive individual research project focused on the analysis of a 14th century masonry mausoleum complex in Soltaniyeh, Iran. I developed a parametric program for thrust analysis in the dome, using Grasshopper for Rhino, to explore the role of the dome geometry and structure. In addition, I prepared a scaled 3D printed model of the dome for seismic analysis using tilt table testing. This research, which will shortly be published, is one of the first comprehensive structural analyses of this dome ever undertaken.

Sep 2015 - Present · 6 yrs 9 mos
I am a PhD student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department here at MIT. Under my advisor, Prof. Saman Amarasinghe, I do research in the area of compilers and high performance computing. 

In this area, I am generally interested in developing domain specific languages (DSLs) that allow non-expert programmers to write code that achieves runtime performance rivaling expertly hand-tuned code. 

More specifically, my PhD topic is on creating a DSL for implementing data compression algorithms. Data compression theory and algorithm development have been widely researched topics for several decades, but little attention has been given to the actual implementation. Current data compression implementations involve large amounts of code, most of which is un-optimized, as optimizing that amount of code is an extremely difficult task. As big data continues to take over, more and more data must be compressed, and with un-optimized code, it is (and will continue to be) prohibitively expensive to compress the necessary data, particularly while maintaining high fidelity. These issues are classic problems that high performance DSLs can be used to solve, hence the motivation behind my research topic.

Prior to starting the data compression work, I also completed my Master’s degree at MIT under Prof. Amarasinghe. My Master’s research was focused on developing a scheduling language for generating distributed and parallelized code that ran simultaneously on heterogeneous processors.

I am a second-year PhD student at MIT. I am enrolled in both the Social & Engineering Systems Program, and the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Statistics. They focus on the applications of mathematics, statistics, and other computational methods to the study of socially significant questions.

• Research
My main research is on causal inference methods for drug repurposing for Alzheimer's Disease, using observational data from Electronic Health Records in the US and UK. I am currently working with Professor Roy Welsch, from the Operations Research Center and Sloan School of Management.

I am also collaborating with Dr. Leo Celi from the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science on data science questions in critical care medicine, with a focus on time series models for the prediction of adverse events.

More generally, I am interested in leveraging non-traditional data for public health. An ongoing project is on the use of news media data to model disease outbreaks, and assess the differences in health-related language between US states.

• Activities & Societies
I am contributing to the organization of MIT Policy Hackathon, leading our communications and external relations efforts.

Many people begin mathematics by studying numbers. As they advance through the curriculum, they discover many different types of objects: sets, functions, groups etc. Each object has its own set of rules and relationships to other concepts. Though diverse, all of these rules and objects share a reliance on an underlying logic to make decisions about what is true and false. Similarly, as you study the logic that underlies these objects, you also find that there is also large number of logics, each sharing the same basic “logical framework”.  This is also true for logical frameworks, which all share a “Module”.  At each layer of abstraction, we get closer to a truly general representation of all of mathematics, computer science, and ideas in a general sense.

For my Bachelor’s thesis, I used these principles of abstraction to develop a language-independent automated theorem prover for the Module System for Mathematical Theories (MMT) in Scala using an agent-oriented design. This involved developing an agent-based architecture, creating proof and knowledge representation data-structures, and creating valid proof tactics for any formal type theory. This prover is general enough to prove theorems in any language of mathematics including set theory, category theory, homotopy type theory, first order logic, propositional logic, economic theories, legal theories, and many more.
Yale University Active Galactic Nuclei Research Group

Recently, Astronomers discovered that a black hole lies at the center of almost every galaxy in the universe. Some of these black holes are actively devouring their host galaxies, and are called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). It was my task to determine the distance to an AGN using only a small amount of noisy data. 

I developed an automated system to mine data on AGN and use it to predict their distances from Earth. I used Bash and SQL to query several online databases and join the relevant data together. I then processed the data using python, and fed it into a parametric model called lePHARE to estimate the distance to the galaxy. I then updated this pipeline to use my model selection tool META, which improved my results considerably.

Vector-Like Quark Research Group at ATLAS
Jun 2013 - Sep 2013 · 4 mos
Geneva Area, Switzerland
I worked with Kenan Jia under the supervision of Professor Tobias Golling and Mark Cooke from LBNL to creating a cut-based analysis to search for a theoretical particle called the “Vector-like quark (VLQ)” in the data generated from the ATLAS detector at CERN. This particle is necessary in most extensions of the standard model of particle physics without supersymmetry. This project involved studying simulated particle collisions to identify where the Vector-Like quark was likely to arise. Using this monte-carlo data and C++, we investigated a large number of analyses to find one that maximized the power of our statistical tests. This project involved large datasets, distributed computing systems, and data visualization. This was internally published in an ATLAS note (ATL-COM-PHYS-2014-474).

Developed a method to identify isolated leptons that were missed by the CMS reconstruction algorithm, which were part of the background of a search for long-lived particles. This method uses a deepSets architecture which takes as input the rec. hits in the detector; shown to increase signal acceptance by 5% and reduce the lepton backgrounds of the search by 40-50% across signal regions; method has applicability to other analyses for its accuracy at identifying leptons. Working on devising another technique to suppress the other components of the background of this search.

Annaliese Meyer,"(she/her) I am a PhD student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, focused on trace metal oceanography and proteomics, with an emphasis on applications to space exploration. Over the past several years, my research has involved taking samples from 7000 m below the sea surface to launching sounding rockets to 9000 m above ground level. I believe that being comfortable hopping between wildly different fields and environments is essential for a successful career in an inherently interdisciplinary field like astrobiology. Beyond research, I am passionate about space policy, particularly in the realm of planetary protection and responsible international cooperation in space. “Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.” ― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","PHD Student

Assisted in a Class 100 clean lab for trace metals analysis and acid-cleaned approximately 75 sample bottles and tubes per week for use in the autosampler. Collected samples onboard the CCGS John P. Tully for trace metals analysis for the Line P time series using Go-Flo bottles on a wire. Actively looked for ways to assist other crew members in off-hours on both cruises. Became comfortable working independently in unusual conditions and at irregular hours at sea for several weeks at a time. Currently processing citizen science seawater samples in lab.

Sep 2015 - Aug 2019 · 4 yrs
Researched and designed scientific payloads to be launched to 30 000 ft. in a student-built sounding rocket. Handled live specimens and analyzed samples in the field post-launch using light microscopy, dissection and direct observation, on-site microbiological culture growth, and performed extensive reviews of the relevant current literature. Directed a specialized team of approximately 10 undergraduate students, worked with a larger team of approximately 50 students from various faculties and liaised with school and governmental agencies. Became proficient at quickly picking up new techniques, such as performing wet lay-ups of carbon fibre, basic circuitry and drafting iterative payload designs. Currently investigating UV-induced DNA damage via an in-flight sterilization system, intended for future use as a safe sample retrieval system to facilitate sample retrieval from potentially water-bearing planets. We are investigating the conserved DNA repair pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, namely, the role of bacterial recA and eukayotic recA homologs in DNA repair. The effects of launch conditions on this particular protein will be investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae recA homolog knockouts (rad52, rad52) transformed with recA in the lab. https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/rocketry/team/

As part of the COR-NIMH program, I worked on the role of gene transcription in the extinction of fear memories, which introduced me to behavioral experiments, injections and data analysis in Sandra Pena de Ortiz’s laboratory.  During the following three years, I continued my work in Sandra’s laboratory studying the role of cAMP Responsive Element Binding protein (CREB) on extinction memory, which is known to be one of the factors that is affected in people who have post-traumatic stress disorder.  I learned molecular techniques such as DNA amplification and genotyping and designed my own protocol to access extinction memory using CREB transgenic mice.  I also had the opportunity to present my work at several international conferences that exposed me to high quality research outside Puerto Rico.

Developed novel tools for classifying X-ray binaries (XRBs) into black holes or neutron stars using machine learning.
•	Compared and developed custom code for 3 methods (Bayesian Gaussian Process (BGP), K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) to predict XRB classifications. The BGP was used in 2015, but SVM and KNN were never used prior for classifying XRBs.
•	Tested these methods on higher resolution MAXI/GSC data which agreed with the results from RXTE/ASM data from the BGP tested in 2015.
•	Concluded that KNN and SVM on average predict the correct classifications with greater probability and speed than the BGP, with exceptions for specific systems.
•	Learned to use the Odyssey Supercomputer and coding languages R and python to manage large datasets in the process.
•	Presented results at the Summer Intern Symposium and the California-Harvard Astrophysics Collaboration (CHASC).
•	Won Best Astrophysics Talk at Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium, Rice University
•	Funded to return to Boston for March 16-24, 2020 to finish our analysis for the paper and collaborate in person

Examining the impacts of increasing temperatures on the thermal tolerance and distribution of oysters and blue mussels in the New England rocky intertidal ecosystem. Measuring oyster and blue mussel thermal tolerance will help predict the future distribution of these species as oceans continue to warm. The research consists of field surveys and collecting bivalves for lab experiments. Lab experiments will assess suspension-feeding and growth rates, along with overall survivorship, at varying temperatures (ambient and slightly elevated to simulate a rise in seawater temperatures). Assessing these effects in these already well-documented organisms will provide nuance to potential mitigation and conservation strategies of the rocky intertidal ecosystems of New England.

I’m passionate about helping people innovate.

Innovation is the single most important activity that companies can perform.  Innovation isn’t just coming up with new ideas — it’s putting those ideas into action to create value! Everyone and every company has the ability to improve the way they innovate.

I’ve been working for 25+ years and teaching for 17+ years. By combining my academic experiences and real-world experiences I bridge the gap between theory and practice. I provide practical tools that can be used immediately and my consulting is rooted in proven successes.

Before coming to MIT, I spent two years as a pre-doctoral fellow in the Clinical Center Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health, where my research focused on the ethics of measures that aim to improve health behaviorMy current research interests are in ethics, metaethics, and the philosophy of action. I am especially interested in the ethics of manipulation and other forms of influence, especially as implemented by large public and private entities. I am also interested in the ethics of technology and ethics pedagogy. I serve as the Assistant Director for Experiential Ethics, MIT's new ethics of technology course for undergraduates, and as a Teaching Fellow for Embedded EthiCS at Harvard.Originally from Boulder, Colorado, I enjoy hiking, spending time outside, and exploring new parts of the East coast.","PhD Student

María Eugenia Inda,"I'm a Pew postdoctoral fellow in the Lu Lab at MIT. I'm working on the development of novel noninvasive strategies for the early diagnosis and alleviation of inflammation in intestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A variety of bacteria inhabit healthy human intestines, so we've been working to commandeer some of these microbes for use as “sentinels” that could patrol the gut and secrete therapeutic molecules in areas that appear inflamed. I'm equipping bacteria with biosensors that recognize the molecular markers of IBD—and then trigger the release of anti-inflammatory compounds. I'm assessing the engineered microbes’ ability to distinguish between diseased and healthy tissue and to treat inflammation in an animal models of IBD.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Eugenia knows the importance of mastering communication skills for pushing her scientific career forward. She used her prowess to show evaluators the value of her ideas in order to become a Pew Postdoctoral Fellow in the Synthetic Biology Center at MIT. In Timothy Lu’s lab, she’s investigating the bacteria dwelling in our intestines. Specifically, she’s working to commandeer some of these microbes for use as “sentinels” that could be engineered to patrol the gut and recognize the molecular markers of inflammatory disease. She received a doctorate in Microbiology in 2014 from the National University of Rosario, Argentina, where she was a teaching assistant and directed undergraduate theses. She’s thrilled to be a part of the Comm Lab because helping colleagues develop their communication skills is meaningful to her as a contribution to both scientists and Science, as a whole. Outside her research, she loves capturing the beauty of everyday life with her Nikon D3400 camera.

My thesis is entitled: “Study of the mechanism of thermo detection of DesK, a histidin kinase thermosensor of Bacillus subtilis”, supervised by Dr. Cybulski and Dr. de Mendoza. During the last six years, including undergraduate and PhD research, I have been studying the mechanism by which the two component system DesK-DesR detects temperature downshifts and regulates gene expression in order to remodel membrane fluidity.
As regards skills developed during my training I would like to highlight the following: genetic engineering- i.e. site-directed mutagenesis and cloning-, protein engineering by rational design, protein purification, including soluble and membrane proteins, liposome construction together with protein reconstitution in liposomes, protein kinetics, lipids purification and lipid biochemistry.

Steven Meisler,"I am a PhD Student in the Harvard-MIT program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's and Bachelor's degree in bioengineering with minors in jazz studies, mathematics, and engineering entrepreneurship. I am also an avid jazz musician (primarily a vibraphonist since 2008), and have sought opportunities to jointly pursue my passions for engineering and music. I am interested in using multimodal neuroimaging and elctrophysiological approaches to explore the relationship between brain structure and function, using neurodevelopmental and learning disorders as models. I would enjoy connecting with anyone who shares a similar intrigue in the intersection of arts, neuroscience, and engineering.","PhD Student

2018 - 2023
System Dynamics is a methodological framework to understand, design, and manage change. Using data and technology, System Dynamics models the relationships between all the parts of a system and how those relationships influence the behavior of the system over time. I'm interested in studying complex systems in which upstream decision making (with imperfect information) has long-term consequences, often beyond the attention span of the original decision maker. Examples include an extended view of product life-cycle management that stretches from initial concept to final product disposition. I'm especially interested in the wider costs of product/system failure and recalls.

Caitlin Haner,"I am currently pursuing my MBA at MIT Sloan as part of a pivot from an Army career to a civilian one. During my eight years in the military, I served as a U.S. Army Special Operations Civil Affairs Officer and a UH-60 Blackhawk MEDEVAC pilot. I have extensive experience working in both U.S. military and embassy environments where I evaluated and actioned items from the whole-of-government approach (defense, development, and diplomacy). I believe that corporate partners in technology are vital for effective national security and aim to contribute to those partnerships in my career post-MBA.","MBA Candidate

Courtney (Sharpe) Jacobovits,"A constant in my career has been removing barriers to help people thrive. In all my endeavors I seek understanding and connection. I believe in meeting people where they are to help them get to where they want to be. I am fascinated by the reality that everything is interconnected. To expand my awareness, I have studied history, religion, design, urban planning, finance, and sustainability. Due to a longstanding love of people and culture I have taken courses in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Hebrew, Turkish, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha), and Moroccan Arabic (Darija). On my own I have also studied Portuguese, Russian, and Romanian. While I only claim fluency in English my reading comprehension remains strong across the romance languages. My interests are broad and I wouldn't want it any other way. I am a frequent panelist on topics related to design, diversity, urban planning, and cultural matters. I have been a guest lecturer at Harvard College, Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD), Wentworth Institute of Technology, and Northwestern University. I have been an architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning critic for institutions such as the GSD, University of Michigan, and Boston Society of Landscape Architects. If asked, I'll happily answer questions about myself and have done so for countless students and job seekers. I've also been interviewed for a couple of podcasts and have been featured in a print edition of Metropolis magazine. I have had pieces published published in design anthologies and Jewish community blogs.If my interests resonate with you, let's talk! Send me a message about what we could do together.

Complementing this project I also cold-called 1000+ immigrants to share resources for personal and community advancement and lobbied elected officials to advocate for increased services for at-risk communities.

Social Entrepreneurship Fellow
PresenTense · Self-employed
Dec 2011 - Jun 2012 · 7 mos
The fellowship enabled me to explore means of alleviating the negative health impacts of living in places with inequitable food access by providing support for research and business plan development coaching. My venture was 'Grandma's Pantry', a brick and mortar greengrocer that would provide on-site nutrition and meal planning guidance. I gained support for my idea through pitching to crowds ranging from 5-150 people but I ultimately decided not to pursue it at that time due to a personal health issue. I credit this experience with steering me towards urban planning as a way to influence community outcomes at a large scale.

Thames Tideway Tunnel - Central Section 

I managed the construction costs for the main tunnels of the central section of ""London's Super Sewer"". This section of the works consisted of 12.7 km of tunnels excavated with two TBMs under the River Thames, serving as an upgrade to London's existing sewage system. As part of my duties, I had to define and maintain a budget for the entire Scope of Work, including labour, plant and materials. 

Besides, I reported monthly the EVM performance of the project defining the main KPIs (such as CPI, SPI, Target vs. Cost) and generating visual dashboards to reflect key insights in a visual manner.  Following this exercise, I acted as a link between the Project Controls team and the Construction team, defining cost-saving strategies and translating the potential risk into quantifiable value for decision-making purposes.

In the forecasting side, I was responsible for producing a monthly short term forecast based on the Program to Build and the Contract/P.O.s terms and a semi-annually long term forecast for cash-flow.

As an Associate Project Manager, I had to coordinate a multidisciplinary team of +20 subcontractors, reaching peaks of over 25 crews working simultaneously and monthly productions exceeding $6 M. At the same time, I worked together with the Technical Office to optimize constructability and cost through design modifications and phasing.

As a side position, I acted as the link between the local power suppliers, designer and construction team for the design and construction of the energy supply points for the lighting tolling systems for the whole project.

The aim of this project was to use alpha-crystallin protein as a model for long-term protein damage and degradation. To this end, I attempted to express and purify alpha-crystallin from E. Coli using a plasmid. Using purchased bovine lens protein, I modified alpha-crystallin's lysine residues using citraconic anhydride in-vitro. Lastly, alpha-crystallin's chaperone function was used to evaluate the effect of the lysine modification using the insulin B-chain as a substrate.

Nur Ahmed,"I am a Postdoc at MIT Sloan & MIT CSAIL. I completed my PhD from Ivey Business School, Canada and was a Research Fellow at the ScotiaBank Digital Banking Lab. My focus is broadly on Innovation, entrepreneurship and technology strategy.For the latest update please see: https://www.nurahmed.com/My research examines firms’ innovation and technology strategy, more specifically corporate science and R&D disclosure strategy. I examine the factors that motivate firms to pursue basic scientific research and voluntarily disclose internal research in the public domain (e.g., publications, patents). To this end, I build a research program of corporate R&D using Artificial Intelligence as an empirical context. Further, I examine the role of specialized assets like computing power and data in innovation processes. Drawing on strategic management literature, and using Big Data, Machine learning (NLP) and interviews, I build testable models of the world that can help managers to make decisions.","Postdoctoral Associate

Johanna Hising DiFabio,"I have the privilege of directing all administrative aspects of these distinguished senior mid-career MBA degrees, housed within MIT Management’s Sloan School.  Each year, MIT offers 360 global professionals the opportunity to earn their MBA degrees on campus.I lead all administrative aspects of the programs.  Specifically, by collaborating with faculty on the development of innovative curricula; with global organizations on action learning labs to help them meet pressing strategic issues; and, most importantly, with our students to create a learning environment that is second-to-none in terms of the personal development and career enhancement. Working with mid-career executives is my passion and the main reason for my joining MIT in 2010.   I’ve spent my entire career in the area of adult learning, particularly in leadership development, and MIT Sloan is one of the best environments in the world for this. This is due in large part to the Institute’s dedication to action learning, and because of this, we fundamentally change the way students approach challenges and opportunities. It pushes them to rethink how they’ve done things in the past, to apply new lenses and skills to problems, and to create and drive positive change.  Our work together truly reflects MIT Sloan’s mission: “to develop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world and to generate ideas that advance management practice.”The global nature of our community is something that is very important to me personally.  My own cultural lens of how communities come together to learn, both from our similarities and differences, are essential themes that I foster within our dynamic learning environment.  I grew up in Europe, am a Swedish citizen, came to the US to pursue my education.  I also have a young family and we have demanding jobs.  I appreciate how our students make the commitment and sacrifices that it takes to pursue an endeavor as ambitious as our MBA programs.","MIT Sloan School of Management

Lawrence Schmidt,"I joined the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2018 as an Assistant Professor of Finance. My research is at the intersection of finance and macroeconomics. I use a unique combination of theory and applied econometrics to offer a richer picture of risks faced by financial market participants—households, institutional investors, and financial intermediaries—and shed new light on underlying economic mechanisms linking financial markets with the real economy. I am particularly interested in understanding factors which are associated with the risk and return to investments in human capital (that is, the present discounted value of labor income), and how frictions that limit risk sharing in the labor market affect asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics. In addition to studying the risk factors and behavior of households, I have also studied the behavior of institutional investors during financial crises. Prior to joining MIT, I was an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago. I received my Ph.D and M.A. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego and my B.A. in Economics-Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.","Assistant Professor Of Finance

A charity that is doing phenomenal work in the lives of children in South Africa. These children are affected and effected by HIV and AIDS and it was more than a pleasure to give my time and talent to this organization.
As a vocalist for the band Matimba ya Ripfumelo (The Power of Hope), the band travelled to various locations in MA putting on shows and donating a large portion of the profits to Tremendous Hearts.

It was a beautiful experience, it was a humbling experience, it was a growing opportunity I was glad for.
