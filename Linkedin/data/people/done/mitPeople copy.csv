Theodore Riotto,"Engineer, thinker, and human are the three words I use to describe myself and I work towards having my experiences and life match them. This can be exemplified by obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering from Lehigh University, which certainly developed me as an engineer, but also why I chose to pursue minors in Entrepreneurship and Political Science. I seek to become an exceptional engineer who also solves not only technical issues, but issues that confront humanity. Work experiences I have had further exemplify how I live by these descriptors including focusing sustainability research projects, learning how to confront non-standard problems on the Baja SAE team, and taking on technically difficult projects at MPR Associates. I hope to continue living by these three words as I further my education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as I pursue a Master's of Science in Chemical Engineering Practice.","Teacher Assistant

Treasurer
Aug 2020 - Aug 2021 · 1 yr 1 mo
I was proud to serve as team treasurer which required contacting previous sponsors, securing new ones, and finding ways to reduce team costs. Key accomplishments in the role included creating and maintaining the team budget, generating a cash flow, and tracking team purchases. 

A secondary role to being treasurer was serving as the advisor to the team captain. This included offering advice on team goal creation, informing them of team financials, and aiding in project execution.
Team Captain
Sep 2019 - Aug 2020 · 1 yr
As the team captain, I oversaw all team operations. In particular, I supervised goal and design creation, task execution, and team development. Responsibilities included organizing weekly activities, ensuring technical specification compliance, and corresponding with the university, SAE, alumni, and sponsors. 

My time as captain also included navigating the team through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the difficulty of maintaining team operations in a virtual environment, I was able to continue design work, adapt policies for the new semester, and set the team up for success once the season resumed.

Engineer Intern
MPR Associates, Inc. · Full-time
May 2020 - Jul 2020 · 3 mos
As a remote intern, I framed, planned, and created a tool to estimate the average temperature within a transformer control cabinet with a fellow intern. The project goal was to deliver added functionality and create a standard framework for engineers to evaluate these thermal systems. 
My partner and I were able to transform the open ended problem into final deliverable by identifying required and key inputs, determining the relevant heat transfer models, and implementing the solution into a user friendly interface. The end tool was able to deliver on the objective temperature along with other outputs useful for evaluation. In addition to the tool itself, a thorough user manual was also written to guide future engineers.
Valuable experience gained from the internship includes project management, framing a problem, and furthering my professional writing ability.
Co-op Engineer
Aug 2019 - Jan 2020 · 6 mos

As a co-op engineer at MPR Associates, my time included working on a variety of projects both within the chemical engineering field and other disciplines. Key projects I contributed to included computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis, transient flow analysis in piping networks, bolt stress evaluation, and root cause investigations. All work was conducted in multidisciplinary teams and included correspondence within the project teams and with the client. 
The keynote project of my rotation was diagnosing degraded steam generator performance at sister nuclear power stations by analyzing chemistry and thermal performance data. My key contributions include performing the potential cause investigation on with thermal performance issues, researching relevant industry experience, and identifying potential solutions to resolve the problem. Ultimately my work was integrated into a larger report delivered to the client. 
During my time with MPR Associates I furthered my teamwork and collaboration skills along with practicing my technical expertise. I learned how to correspond with a client and gained experience working in a professional setting.
Undergraduate Research Assistant
Lehigh University
Aug 2018 - May 2019 · 10 mos
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
As an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Baltrusaitis's lab group, I worked on two open ended tasks along with my research partner. With each project, it was up to my partner and I to set the project schedule, tasks, and goals while Dr. Baltrusaitis and two graduate students served in advisory roles. 

The first project involved investigating several particle size characterization techniques to study the growth rate of struvite in aqueous systems. Characterization techniques of interest involved a capillary hydrodynamic fractionation(CHDF), and Zetasizer device. The results of the project were inconclusive as neither characterization technique was suited to studying the system of interest. 

With the second project, more promising results were obtained. This project was a crystallization study of urea with two known urease inhibitors to create a co-crystal structure. We started from knowing what we wanted to produce, and through small scale studies, created a system which could successfully produce polycrystaline co-crystals. Because of timing, I had to leave the project with the next steps being to form a single co-crystal material.

- For several years, most of the genomic DNA in human cells were thought of as 'junk'. However, a huge percentage of these 'junk' DNA are being actively transcribed at least at some period of time during a human's lifespan. The transcripts of these 'junk' DNA are called long non-coding RNAs (linc- or lnc-RNA) if they are more than 200nt long and do not code for a polypeptide. Some of these RNAs play an important role in gene regulation, especially during embryonic development. For example, the linc-RNA named XIST is extremely important in sliencing the entire X chromosome in female cells as a mechanism for X-chromosome dosage compensation.

- In my project, I studied a novel linc-RNA that becomes highly expressed when embryonic stem cells are coerced into differentiation along the neuronal lineage. This linc-RNA was shown to be interacting with chromosome modelling proteins and was also shown to be co- and anti- expressed with particular genes in its immediate vicinity. We think that this linc-RNA may be a crucial/master regulator of downstream genes and ultimately drive neuronal differentiation.

- When a patient suffers from chronic kidney failure, it is very likely that the patient will have to undergo dialysis for the rest of his/her life. Current dialysis methods are insufficient in that they result in drastic swings in waste and electrolyte concentrations in the blood as a result of the periodic nature of dialysis. They are also unable to replenish hormones and metabolites that normal kidney tubule cells produce in the human body as the dialysis machine has no living components.

- In this project, my group designed and tested a bioartificial hemodialysis device whereby live kidney tubule cells are seeded onto the dialysis fibers of the device in an attempt to make the device suitable for a complete renal replacement therapy.

Final Year Project: Cell mechanics - Using magnetic beads to induce pore formation in endothelial cells
Awarded Best Year3 BEng Poster Prize

- Pore formation in endothelial cells is an event in the body that is critical to biological processes such as leukocyte trafficking in blood vessels, aqueous humor drainage in the Schlemm’s canal of the eye and possibly even metastatic events in cancer. It has been hypothesised that pore formation in endothelial cells is initiated by forces exerted by leukocytes or pressure gradients across the drainage system of the eye. 

- In this study, a novel approach, which involved the use of a Halbach array and magnetic microbeads, was employed to investigate the role of mechanical stimulation on endothelial cells in initiating pore formation. The array was modelled, built and tested prior to its usage on cells. The results showed that the array was capable of exerting point forces on cells these forces can induce endothelial cells to form pores.

Harry Liang,"At MIT MechE and MIT CSAIL, I focus on the development of robust machine learning algorithms to accelerate energy materials and drug discovery.I aim to solve the challenges brought by complex search spaces and learning with small datasets by consistently integrating physical knowledge into deep learning and Bayesian algorithms. Some of the algorithms I work with are Bayesian Optimization, CNNs, RNNs, DNN, Gaussian Process/Random Forest Regression, etc. I am also interested in increasing the interpretability of machine learning models and developed tools for interactive data visualization.While I am used to a solution-oriented mindset as an engineer, I am also impact-driven. I seek opportunities to provide value to other people and solve problems that affect society from a broader perspective. I follow through on my commitments, love it when my ideas are challenged, and always curious to learn from others by standing in their shoes. Well connected to the entrepreneur communities in both the Bay Area and Greater Boston Area, nowadays, I hope to learn more in startups, consulting firms, and venture capitals.Outside of work, I am a bold stand-up comedian, podcast host, and part time basketball referee.","PhD student and Graduate Researcher

PhD student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), with Prof. Daniela Rus. My research focuses on building machine learning algorithms for end-to-end control (i.e., perception to actuation) of autonomous systems and formulating guarantees for these algorithms. I have worked on control of autonomous vehicles, formulating confidence of deep neural networks, mathematical modeling of human mobility, as well as building complex inertial refinement systems.

This project proposes to push the limits of autonomous vehicles in terms of speed, precision handling, and safety. We modeled and simulated the dynamical vehicle system in Drake, while using system identification capabilities based on real-data collected from on-board sensors and Drake simulator. Compared to existing systems, which are based solely on physics based models, our use of models derived from real world driving conditions and a physical vehicle provide a more realistic simulation and novel insights into the complex variety of variables encountered in a real driving scenario.

In this project I evaluated the effectiveness of Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient descent in Deep Neural Networks. Despite being widely tested in the convex case, many of these optimization through variance reduction techniques have not been accurately and fairly compared in the non-convex case, and in specific Deep Learning networks. I created, trained, and tested Convolutional NN (CNN), Recursive NN (RNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), and implemented, integrated and evaluated relevant optimization algorithms (SVGD, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, etc) in Theano, and assessed against MNIST and IMDB datasets.

Research internship in MIT's SENSEable City lab with Principal Investigator, Professor Carlo Ratti, and graduate and post-graduate researchers. I am utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze mobile phone data in order to understand the differences in how people move and interact in high risk, developing regions such as the Ivory Coast, versus those in more stable and developed regions, such as Europe and the US. The goal is to illuminate the vulnerabilities of people in such regions, with a potential result of providing governments and aid organizations with tools to better address societal needs through urban planning, infrastructure, and services such as public transportation, mobile banking, social programs.

I am developing mathematical models in MATLAB, and creating software tools for geospatial and temporal visualizations of the data and models. My project is part of a grassroots initiative called Developers for Development, in which software developers and data scientists volunteer their expertise to help developing nations.

Research internship in the Contextual Content Analysis lab with Principal Investigator, Professor Noel O'Connor, and graduate and post-graduate researchers. During this internship I developed a real-time system for tennis sensor data analysis and feedback for motion refinement, based on algorithms I had previously discovered. The system I designed and developed includes an offline training component, which uses advanced machine learning algorithms to train player-specific models for use by the real-time motion refinement system. The real-time system captures, splits, translates, calibrates, de-noises, normalizes, and computes features from the wireless inertial sensor data; it detects potential strokes, identifies the type of stroke and deviations from reference strokes; and finally, it generates precise, and unbiased feedback to the player or coach - all in real-time.

Top prizewinner in the 23rd European Union Young Scientist competition for project: Tennis Sensor Data Analysis: An Automated System for Macro-motion Refinement. The competition was restricted to 87 student winners of their respective national science competition, aged 21 and under, from 37 countries. Projects are assessed on scientific achievement and jury interviews. The 3 top prizewinners each receive €7000, and trips to the London International Youth Science Forum and Nobel Prize ceremonies in Stockholm, Sweden.

Key results of my project included an analysis of over 400 GB of tennis sensor data, and development of models and algorithms for detecting the subtle differences in motion and orientation that enabled automatically distinguishing between 15 different tennis stroke types (e.g., a forehand flat versus forehand topspin) using only inertial data. I was able to achieve 96% accuracy across all stroke types, with 98% accuracy for 11 of the 15 strokes, and 99% or higher for 6 of the 15 strokes.

My results were tested rigorously through cross validation over millions of samples and on a variety of skill levels, physical builds, and geographies. I also designed and developed a real-time computer system to demonstrate the accuracy and low latency of my algorithms, as well as the capability to provide the player or coach with immediate, precise, and unbiased feedback on how to refine their motions and orientations for improved performance.

My results are significant because previously published research relied on video and inertial sensing, which requires a fixed and significantly more expensive infrastructure, and focused on identifying stroke classes (e.g., forehand versus backhand), which is too coarse-grained to support computer-assisted skill refinement.

I am a primary contributor to TACO, a compiler for sparse tensor computations. I have also worked on Simit, a domain-specific programming language for computing on sparse systems.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

I generalized the TACO tensor algebra compiler theory to support efficiently computing with sparse tensors that are stored in a wide range of disparate data structures. These generalizations speed up real-world sparse tensor algebra computations by letting users store their data in specialized data structures that are optimized for the data. I also developed a more user-friendly compiler front end for Simit, a programming language for computing on sparse systems using linear algebra. This new front end was later also adapted for use in the compiler for GraphIt, a graph programming language. 

In addition, I developed a web interface for TACO (http://tensor-compiler.org/codegen) that lets users try out the tool online without having to install it on their own machines.

I helped designed and then fully implemented a replacement for a system used internally to collect, sort, analyze and store crash reports and usage statistics sent by customers of Sybase products. I also organized and carried out migration of huge amounts of existing data to new system, which requried extensively planning. I was able to successfully implement the system mainly in SQL despite little prior experience with the language or database technology in general.

I research designing low-cost 7 degrees-of-freedom arms under Professor Pieter Abbeel. 

In these two years, we have designed from scratch a low-cost, human safe, human-sized, compliant 7 degrees-of-freedom arm called Blue. I prototyped and explore the space of robot grippers in order to design a robust, low-cost, and human safe gripper. Using cycle testing and HALT testing, I benchmarked the durability, repeatability, and safety of each gripper; able to withstand 40,000 cycles of force loading and 50,000 impact collisions with no loss of function. The gripper was also designed to be injection moldable through collaboration with engineers at Protolabs, a contract manufacturer. Please visit my google scholar page for a full (ICRA 2019) paper of this research.

In addition to designing the gripper, I also am in charge of the rapid prototyping division of manufacturing. I organized and optimized a fleet of 13 3D printers to keep up with in-house rapid prototyping and product manufacturing. I also designed and machined metal components at UC Berkeley's machine shop.

For picking robots, the motivation is to design optimal fingertips to improve grasp success rates for parallel jaw bin picking robots. I led a project to explore data-driven optimization of gripper surfaces within a design space of shape, texture, and compliance. I published the work as the first author in a paper in the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2017). 

In the space of surgical robotics, our lab wants to automate processes in minimally invasive surgery to aid surgeons in these procedures. I designed a passive instrument mount to assist tool-changing within the body. I was the co-author on the work published in the Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2016). 

The motivation for precision agriculture is to optimize drip irrigation and plant yield. The project I worked on was a precision irrigation co-robotic device that will adjust drip irrigation valves. My work was on using image processing to quantify the uncertainty of the device as it adjusts valves. I was the co-author on the work published in the Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2016).

llini 4000 is a student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization at the University of Illinois that raises money for cancer research & patient support services and documents the American cancer experience through annual cross-country bike rides. Hoping to contribute to research dollars instead of just using them and with a desire to understand the human ramifications of disease before beginning graduate study, I joined I4K my senior year; alongside a team of 16 fellow students, I rode coast-to-coast from Central Park in NYC to the Golden Gate Bridge in SF over the course of summer 2019. In total, I raised over $5,300 in a team total of over $70,000 for donation to causes both local (e.g. the UIUC Relay for Life, UIUC Cancer Center) and national (e.g. the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, Camp Kesem). During the ride itself, I coordinated the team's Portraits Project, a video documentation of the stories of patients, caregivers, and survivors of cancer from those we met on our journey. Altogether, my experience in I4K was incredibly inspiring and humbling as a scientist-in-training and one which instilled a deep appreciation for the beauty of the country and the diversity of people who live within it.

Urbana-Champaign, Illinois
Phantoms are devices that reconstitute the anatomy and imaging properties of an organ, serving as surrogates for tissue in biomedical research, surgical training, and medical education. On a student team guided by Dr. Wawrzyniec Dobrucki, I conducted literature reviews to identify challenges in phantom design, performed material testing to optimize materials and fabrication to best approximate cardiac tissue, and explored pumping mechanisms capable of replicating muscular dynamism. Mindful of the lack of phantoms capable of providing dynamic data across imaging modalities, we devised our phantom to be MRI, x-ray CT, and ultrasound compatible; doing so, we could calibrate different imaging equipment to the same specifications and advance the accuracy of cross-platform analyses in biomedical research.
With a prototype after our first year, I spearheaded a poster presentation of our work at the 2016 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting. By the conclusion of my sophomore year, the team realized that we could bring our research to market as a tool for pre-surgical analyses and medical education. Entering the Cozad New Venture Competition (the flagship entrepreneurship competition at the University of Illinois), we placed 3rd in the 2017 competition and incorporated as a student-run start-up named PhantomCor shortly thereafter. Over the following year, we participated in the iVenture Accelerator, participated in NSF I-Corps programs locally and nationally, applied for an NIH SBIR grant, and returned to the BMES Annual Meeting in 2017 for an oral presentation. As the team’s Technical Writing Lead, I served as the primary contributor to applications, grants, and presentations submitted to these programs. By the time I graduated, my experience on the team had acquainted me with a variety of biomedical imaging techniques, imparted a deep appreciation for translational research, and taught me the value of communicating research to diverse audiences.
Formed as a Design Team under the University of Illinois Biomedical Engineering Society, PhantomCor is a student-run start-up developing cardiac and liver phantoms for use in imaging analyses and surgical training. Under the mentorship of Dr. Wawrzyniec Dobrucki, PhantomCor was founded in late 2015 by Hiba Shahid (team lead), Viraat Goel, Alex...
Summer Research Scholar
SENS Research Foundation · Internship
May 2018 - Aug 2018 · 4 mos
Boston, Massachusetts, United States
Following my junior year, I spent the summer researching regenerative medicine through the Sens Research Foundation Summer Scholars Program (SSP) due to the potential I believed cell-based therapies had for addressing neurodegeneration. Placed in Dr. Khalid Shah’s neurosurgery lab at Harvard Medical School, I worked alongside a postdoc to CRISPR-engineer cancer cells to have a receptor-based antitumor effect in in vitro and in vivo models for glioblastoma, lung cancer, and melanoma. I quickly became proficient with lab techniques including transfection, transduction, FACS analysis, cryosectioning, staining, IVIS, and mouse surgery. In vitro work entailed engineering several different cancer cell lines to secrete apoptosis-inducing molecules of interest, preventing autocrine toxicity by knocking out death receptors, and adding a prodrug-activated kill switch; in vivo testing involved implanting primary tumor xenografts into syngeneic mouse models to measure the therapy’s effect on residual cancerous growth following surgical resection. Preliminary results by the summer’s end showed residual primary tumor eradication and therapeutic cell localization to both primary and metastatic tumor sites. As a part of the program, I also wrote a mock grant proposal for my project and orally presented my work at the SSP Symposium in La Jolla, CA, in October 2018.

Following a new research lead in the lab, I was tasked with exploring the influence of the Wnt signaling pathway on the aggregation of a presynaptic protein serving as a pathophysiological hallmark of PD called α-synuclein (α-syn). Because Wnt signaling was found to be dysregulated in PD by a collaborator, we hypothesized that pathway activation could influence α-syn aggregation. Given the autonomy to design experiments, learn from mistakes, and develop my research methodology, I conducted protein complementation and cytotoxicity assays in a human neuroglioma cell line modified to overexpress α-syn. Using Wnt3a ligand treatments to activate the canonical Wnt pathway, I tracked changes in α-syn aggregation. Supporting my findings with immunofluorescence images, Western blots, and a series of control experiments isolating the effect of treatment, I found results indicating that canonical Wnt pathway activation significantly reduces α-syn aggregation and toxicity without destroying α-syn molecules. This work was presented orally at Mayo and with a poster at the 2017 BMES Annual Meeting. In addition to teaching me about the design and implementation of new research projects, my experience at the Mayo Clinic deepened my interest in neurological diseases and set me on the path to grad school.

I assisted in a tissue engineering lab, CV-PEUTICS, led by Dr. Ramaswamy at FIU, which focuses on heart valve research. I published an undergraduate thesis titled ""Effects of oscillatory flow patterns on rat valvular endothelial and interstitial cells"". I exposed the cells to different flow profiles to determine how the flow environment affects calcification of the heart valve. In this laboratory I have practiced cell culturing, harvesting cells from a donor, using a microfluidic channel system, and running qPCR. In addition, I have presented at several poster sessions within the university and was accepted as an oral presenter at national conferences, BMES and ABRCMS.

For a summer internship, I assisted in developing a multiplexed assay for infectious disease diagnosis. The importance of this research comes from the lack of available methods for detecting the type of pathogen that a patient is infected with. The novelty of this assay comes from its high specificity, high capacity for diagnosing a large variety of pathogens, and cost-effectiveness. It implements genetic screening with probe-ligation based technology. Our results were a 9 organism-multiplexed assay that tested for fungi, bacteria, and viruses.

I had the opportunity to be a research assistant volunteer in Dr. Kalai Mathee's laboratory at FIU. The main goal of the laboratory was to perform Molecular Genetic Studies of Bacterial Pathogenicity Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the Model Organism. My project at the time was to determine the effect that a specific point mutation on a clinical strain had on the alginate producing pathway of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. I was able to develop skills which included plating a bacterial culture, inoculating cells, triparental mating, PCR and gel electrophoresis. In addition, I prepared another student's thesis for publication and in the process learned how to use EndNote and publish a paper in BioArchive.

Robert Weinberg,"Dr. Robert Weinberg, D.O., J.D., has been involved with neurology research into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Bob received his B.S. degree in Biology from M.I.T. in 1976.  During his undergraduate years, he was awarded a grant for research funding from Harvard Medical School for research on an epizootic disease of an inbred rat strain NEDH Kx.  In 1978 Bob co-authored a landmark immunology paper on the structure and function of human idiotypic immunoglobulins in the Journal of Immunology while doing research at Boston Children's Hospital.  Following medical school (D.O.,1986), Bob did postgraduate residency training in Pathology at Brown University, and then did postgraduate residency training in Internal Medicine.  Subsequently Bob spent about 20 years in clinical medical practice dividing his time between Family Medicine at the Boston Evening Medical Center and Emergency Medicine at local community hospitals.  Bob then obtained a Juris Doctor degree cum laude from the New England School of Law in 2006 with a concentration in Intellectual Property and Patent Law.

Supporting a NASA-APRA funded research project focused on developing control algorithms for spinning and slewing dynamics of a rotating strip aperture (RSA) space telescope concept. Control algorithms will be tested on the dynamics and controls testbed (DCT), which simulates aspects of the low earth orbit environment using a three-axis air bearing and Helmholtz Cage. 

My efforts have been focused on developing the attitude sensing suite which includes an optical camera and IMU. I developed an attitude determination testbed (ADT) to characterize the performance of the attitude estimates produced by the sensor suite. Performance characterization involved geometric camera calibration and statistical analyses of noise distributions for attitude and angular rate estimates produced by the camera and IMU. 

Additionally, I performed computational analyses of potential science data return from various orbital regimes for an RSA telescope concept. By modeling an RSA system's inertia tensor and optical payload in STK attitude simulator, I am creating a data set of required attitude controller authorities for attitude control system selection.

Performed thermal analysis of hypersonic wind tunnel wall panels with embedded thermal plugs using Autodesk Nastran In-CAD and NX Nastran softwares. The results from these analyses were then used to validate a new numerical method for predicting wall surface heat fluxes and wall surface temperatures from subsurface temperature-time readings. Subsurface temperature-time data from the thermal simulations was fed to the Inverse Method which predicted the surface heat fluxes and surface temperatures which were compared to the simulation's surface data. The uncertainty characterization from these simulations provided a basis for the design of unit tests for the experimental characterization of uncertainty associated with the Inverse Method. The thermal simulations revealed inhomogeneities in how heat was transferred through the wind tunnel wall and thermal plug apparatus. Using these results, I optimized the design of the thermal plugs with respect to the homogeneity of heat transfer through them as this would allow the thermocouples threaded through the plug to collect high fidelity temperature data. Design optimization involved an in depth analysis of the effect of application of thermal grease to thermocouple grooves within the plug and the method by which the thermal grease is applied. The unit test involves the impulsive exposure of a wind tunnel wall panel with embedded thermal plugs to a known boundary condition - an ice bath. This required the design of an experimental apparatus which would lower the wind tunnel wall panel repeatedly into an ice bath for which I designed and built a pulley system. I had the thermal plug and unit test plate machined and designed the data collection system with real time temperature outputs from the embedded thermocouples using a National Instruments Data Acquisition Unit and LabView. I am currently conducting the ice bath unit tests.

Conducting tests to characterize the erosion of common spacecraft structural materials and solar panel coatings from simulated micrometeorite impacts in space. These tests are executed by using a high power laser to ablate an asteroid simulant, pyroxene. The ejected plume then impinges a common spacecraft structural material, aluminum, and common solar panel coatings, indium tin oxide and magnesium fluoride. These laser ablation and impingement tests are currently being conducted. The erosion of aluminum, indium tin oxide, and magnesium fluoride will then be measured using an optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope.

During my two summer internships at Argonne National Laboratory (2009 and 2010), I worked with Dr. Klaus Attenkofer doing semiconductor device research. Summer 2009, I worked on a project to reduce noise in avalanche photodiodes used in x-ray detectors. My specific contribution to the project was designing and assembling a circuit board for a thermoelectric cooler controller, and testing the efficacy of using the thermoelectric cooler to reduce noise. Summer 2010, I contributed to a project to develop large-area picoseconds-resolution photodetectors. I studied the absorbance behavior of potential materials for photocathode growth via spectroscopic measurements, and I designed an optomechanical apparatus that allows these measurements to be performed in situ during growth. Under Dr. Attenkofer’s mentorship, I learned such essential research skills as how to work independently, to express myself clearly in a research setting, and to utilize many different resources to solve a problem.

Matthew Ko,"My interest include sustainable and clean energy research by exploring the physics and chemistry of materials. At MIT, I am currently in Yet-Ming Chiang's group researching materials for solid state electrolytes for the next generation of safer and more efficient electric vehicles.At Cornell, I worked in the Muller Group from January 2018 to May 2021 in the Cornell University Engineering Physics department researching fuel cell catalysts. Several projects focused on catalyst support nanostructure  for durable, high power output in PEMFCs, using electron microscopy to understand mechanisms for oxygen diffusion and catalyst degradation. I also investigated non-precious metal catalysts for use in Alkaline fuel cells  using STEM techniques such as atomic resolution EELS.

Hunter Rawlings Presidential Research Scholar in the Muller Group working on characterization of the platinum nanoparticle catalysts used in PEM Fuel Cells. Hydrogen Fuel Cells pose a clean, efficient alternative to fossil fuels for use in electric vehicles. However, these fuel cells use platinum as a catalyst to achieve their best performance, which results in high costs. In the Muller Group, I use TEM techniques to image platinum nanoparticles and the carbon supports they reside on to understand the physical properties that may underlie the performance of a specific type of catalyst. Most recently I have used tomography to reconstruct 3D models of the platinum nanoparticles and carbon supports, and using this data I can calculate quantitative values of the catalyst that correspond to its chemical activity. If we can understand the physical parameters and electronic structure of the catalysts, we can fully optimize a hydrogen fuel cell to make it a competitive fuel.

Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a young class of crystalline, porous materials that have garnered significant attention as a result of their attractive chemical and physical properties. These properties include unprecedented high surface areas and porosity, relatively high chemical and thermal stability, and overall tunability. Currently, MOFs are promising materials in many fields such as gas storage and separation, water purification, and heterogeneous catalysis. My work at Princeton investigated one particular MOF, Cr MIL-101. I practiced synthesis techniques to determine parameters that allow for clean material and confirmed the purity of the material using characterization techniques such as XRD and SEM. Finally, the catalytic activity of Cr MIL-101 was investigated using NMR data taken during the epoxidation of styrene reaction, which Cr MIL-101 is known to catalyze.

Josef Biberstein,"I’m a firm believer that there is no better feeling than watching a device that I built or helped to build work like a charm. From rocket launches at over twice the speed of sound to submersibles diving to hundreds of meters, the fruition of the various projects I have undertaken throughout my high school and undergraduate life have shown me the true joy of being an engineer. I count myself a proud member of the ranks of the maker movement – I love combining tinkering, thinking, and often 3D printing to produce fun and interesting contraptions, and I always aim to learn new things along the way. In the interest of learning even more, I’m currently pursuing a doctorate in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on controls and autonomous systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Outside of academics, I’m both a mountaineer and a sailor, an avid follower of videogame culture, and best friends with my family's beautiful Eurasier puppy. ","Graduate Student Researcher (MIT LIDS)

Graduate Student Researcher
The MGH/HST Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging
Jan 2014 - May 2017 · 3 yrs 5 mos
Charlestown, MA
I worked in the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Fischl, Dr. Douglas Greve, & Dr. David Salat.
I developed novel methods of automatically segmenting human brain images obtained with MRI, particularly in the context of white matter lesions that are evident in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease.
Using these methods, I am interested in studying the cerebrovascular contributions to aging and dementia, which can be inferred from studies of white matter lesions that are of presumed vascular origin. My work focuses on parsing apart the ""multi-hit"" hypothesis of dementia, which strives to identify and target specific constellations of symptoms and pathologies with a long-term goal of providing better and more personalized therapeutic treatment plans for individuals with cognitive impairment.

As the software team lead of the aUToronto self-driving car team, I was responsible for developing and guiding the implementation of the end-to-end software architecture that converts sensor inputs into vehicle movement while incorporating monitoring, fault recovery, and visualization systems. My team was responsible for developing the software infrastructure and components that allow the Autonomy team to interact with the car, including the sensors and vehicle interface. My team also contained optimization and hardware acceleration specialists who helped the Autonomy team develop faster algorithms.

I led my team by taking care of administrative tasks, arranging meetings and standups, managing task assignments and monitoring, and inspiring them to stay motivated towards our goal of winning the competition. I was also a leader to the rest of the aUToronto team, through my role of ensuring that proper software development practices were followed so that all software was written to a high standard of safety and reliability.

I am working on a pipeline that applies unsupervised machine learning to photometric light curves observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We combine feature engineering (using domain knowledge) and feature learning (using convolutional autoencoders) to produce low-dimensional representations of TESS data. By applying clustering algorithms and outlier detection algorithms to our low-dimensional representations, we classify stellar variability in TESS short-cadence light curves.

Automating the classification of stellar variability will allow large scale population studies of many variable stars, which is important for understanding the underlying phenomena and for detecting exoplanets.

I used convolutional neural networks to detect the presence of crater ejecta deposits in images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Impact craters dominate the surfaces of Mars, the Moon, and many other solid planets and moons. Overtime, surface processes (e.g. wind, superimposed impacts) modify the crater shape by removing ejecta and flattening the crater. My pipeline will produce a global map of ejecta removal across Mars, which will be used to inform investigations of martian surface processes.

As part of the effort to monitor the melting of ice shelves buttressing Antarctica, I developed a Python package that optimally fuses seismic and GPS data using the Kalman filter. By studying the data from co-located seismometers and GPS receivers on the Ross Ice Shelf, we can learn about how the ice shelf responds to events like ocean gravity waves and tides.

Collaborating with Dr. Tianmin Shu under Prof. Joshua Tenenbaum in Computational Cognitive Science Lab. I've utilized neural networks to detect and measure the animacy of different entities, animacy meaning whether an entity is ""alive"" or just an inanimate object. It should be able to match human beliefs and perceptions on similar data. In order to do this, I generated data, utilizing Python and Pygame to make graphical simulations involving entities interacting, similar to Heider and Simmel's experiments. The entities are either animate or inanimate objects, and the simulations involve them interacting with each other and the environment. Since creating the data, I've trained a recurrent neural network to extract cues and determine/detect animacy in the different entities. Since doing this, I'm testing the RNN with newly generated situations and comparing to human predictions.

Sebastian (Seb) Barriga,"My experience has allowed me to build knowledge and expertise in identifying superior business models, in which to (a) deploy capital with asymmetric risk/reward profiles and (b) create value alongside talented, industry experts, serving as board members and/or managers -- I admire great leaders that can lead firms. For investments in private markets, I do this best as a part of a team of professionals who complement and balance my views and opinions. For investments in public markets, my approach is individual given risk can be managed with diversification and reward through value investment tools. For the former I have managed third party money, for the latter I absorb all the risk.The values I hold dear are family, happiness, self-reliance, personal growth, purpose, making a difference, mentoring, courage, prestige, and resilience. I have found myself always seeking and tackling more difficult problems with greater challenges.Consequently, my best work happens when profit is aligned with purpose, and when I’m able to engage and motivate my team, and in turn, they can excel independently, maximizing outcomes, using their own voice and talents.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Carmen Sleight Crawford,"Earning my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) meant learning Computer-Aided design (CAD) in Solidworks and Autodesk Fusion, product design from brainstorming to alpha prototype design and building, winning the ‘best project’ title with my robotics team, data collection and analysis, and hands-on manufacturing. I love learning so much that a BSME wasn’t enough, and I’m also going to earn a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. My research focus is the mechanical design of casks for nuclear batteries, or microreactors, which will quadruple my current experience in finite element analysis (FEA).When it comes to using machining equipment, I’ve learned by experience to work carefully rather than quickly, no matter how simple the task, and never to rush through or skip steps. Sometimes, I think it’s easier to say the ways I know how to break things than to explain how to use equipment properly. For example, I know how to burn up equipment with a short in an electrical circuit and how to break Simulink (a Matlab based simulation software) solvers with nonlinear control systems. Anyone might guess how I learned such lessons. Every time I learn such a lesson, I write it down so that I can warn the next person. In the case of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), such a record of my mistakes was key in the development of the in-house manual, which I wrote, and which is still actively used for training.On a 16-person product development team, I often found myself testing prototype performance with users. I often got overwhelmed by the amount of technical input 16 people could collectively provide, and meetings usually went long. I think most people work best in two- to five-person teams, and from now on, if teams get any larger, I will suggest splitting into sub-teams can ensure that everyone feels welcome to contribute.Please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn Messenger or email if you’d like to know more!","Research Assistant

Jan 2020 - Aug 2020 · 8 mos
In the midst of tuning an ultra-high vacuum resistive heating test apparatus, I learned that I love paving the way. Brand-new tasks that a company has never attempted are exactly the sort of projects that thrill me most. The best and most important part of the job is to keep a record and train the people around me. Some might say that's bad job security, but I think it's good practice. I wrote procedures for the aforementioned apparatus, the main production line, and the SEM. I also verified the method for measuring temperatures with a disappearing filament pyrometer, which meant insisting on accuracy. 

Though I enjoyed my projects at Advanced Ceramic Fibers, I hope to transition my career to nuclear fission.

User-centric design may be a good idea in concept, but how is it implemented in engineering design meetings? 

My task was to evaluate transcriptions of student meetings from MIT's 2.009 class, coding each line according to the empathy shown. My supervisor did the same task in parallel, and by the end of the summer, we created a robust system for quantifying the qualitative evidence.

Pablo Leon,"My passion is to develop next-generation materials and methods that will accelerate the creation of jobs and improvement of community health and life. I believe the way to progress on these substantial challenges is through engineering multidisciplinary solutions by understanding the system, its components, and how the system interacts with the environment. Because of this, I have been driven to pursue practical experiences in a diverse set of research topics and uncover the relationships connecting all my works.","Graduate Research Assistant

My research is on creating a computational workflow that autonomously determines the conductivity of novel polymer electrolyte systems. I am automating the end-to-end pipeline, which includes:
1. generating DFT training data of molecular conformations using an in-house database, 
2. predicting interatomic potential parameters using machine learning, 
3. generating molecular dynamics input scripts and data files, 
4. creating a condensed-phase simulation box at experimental concentrations and conditions, 
5. performing the molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS
6. computing the diffusivities, conductivity, and lithium ion transference number.
Through my research, I have learned how to augment an existing codebase with new functionalities and simplified logic. I am the most senior group member in an external collaboration with industry and other research groups and have regularly provided progress updates and work with teams consisting of many nationalities and backgrounds. 

I am also interested in broader applications of clean energy, materials/molecule featurization for machine learning, and development of theory for mechanisms underlying materials properties as seen in the class projects below.
Influence of ion concentration on properties of polycarbonate-based electrolytes
In this project, I used BIOVA Materials Studio to generate amorphous cells of solid polymer electrolyte systems with differing ion concentrations and created Python scripts to compute persistence length and radii of gyration from backbone bond orientation correlation function and ensemble average backbone angles.
Computational analysis of neopentylglycol— an MD and DFT comparison
Determined the solid-state transition and melting critical temperatures for a crystalline molecular solid system. In this project, I used Moltemplate to generate initial supercell structures from a single molecule input file, ran DFT structure relaxations using VASP, and generated Python code to track  inter- and intra-molecular rotations during molecular dynamics simulations.
Learning neutral and charged solute-solvent interactions through solvation energy prediction using machine learning methods
Different representations of the solvent and solute molecules as input to deep neural networks for the prediction of solvation free energy were compared. In this project, I used RDKit, PyTorch, SigOpt, and cleaned experimental benchmarking datasets used by all team members.

Consisted of three computational physics projects. The first project was to solve the Boltzmann Transport Equation to compute the thermal conductivity of 1-D superlattices while using ab initio material parameters. We utilized symmetries and a quadrature discretization of k-space in order to reduce computational costs. This project was coded in Fortran. The second project was to introduce a low-rank representation of the quantum chemistry electronic structure Hamiltonian that allows for efficient implementation on near-term quantum hardware. Third was to compute the long-time dynamics of general physical 1-D quantum systems. This is generally considered to be a difficult problem, but we developed a successful tensor network algorithm based on constructing low-rank approximations of influence functionals. The tensor network code was written in Python and utilized the tensor network library quimb.
Ab initio based investigation of thermal transport in superlattices using the Boltzmann equation: Assessing the role of phonon coherence
The role of the coherent interference of phonons on thermal transport in artificial materials such as superlattices is of intense interest. Recent experimental studies report a non-monotonic trend ...
Low rank representations for quantum simulation of electronic structure
The quantum simulation of quantum chemistry is a promising application of quantum computers. However, for N molecular orbitals, the $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ gate complexity of performing Hamiltonian and unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter steps makes simulation...

Consisted of three projects involving optical and photonic systems. First was to characterize high extinction photonic crystal electro-optical modulators, whose principle of operation was to excite both the fundamental resonant mode and an excited propagating mode to create a Fano resonance. Second was to study and design photonic crystal cavities, and investigate the trade-off between the total footprint, cavity quality factor, and outward radiation. Last was to design and construct a miniature spectrometer, which operated by imaging the Talbot effect in the mid-field diffraction regime and using Fourier transforms to obtain the spectrum.

Bern Multimodal Transit Map
Bahnhof, the main transport hub, is placed at the exact center of the layout. The Altstadt bend of the Aare is at the center, North and South of the bend the river is aligned on the same vertical axis. Rail lines are aligned on 2 diagonal lines that bound the city center, North: Bremgartenstrasse, South: Weissensteinstrasse / Seftigenstrasse.
Basel Multimodal Transit Map
The central tram loop is symbolized by a square with corridors radiating out from it. The two old cities of Grossbasel (big Basel) and Kleinbasel (small Basel) are represented by a circle intersected by the Rhine, echoing the walls that used to enclose the city.
Lausanne Multimodal Transit Map
Our map highlights Lausanne’s multi-level city center crisscrossed by many bridges as well as its iconic position on the shores of Lake Geneva. The main juncture in the bus network—Le Grand-Pont—serves as a navigational tool. From there, buses head east to Lutry and west to Renens, thus creating a strong horizontal axis parallel to the lake.

I am a research assistant, pursuing a PhD relating in the Lab for Aviation and the Environment at MIT. The global aviation industry has a number of impacts on the environment. Most notably, these include impacts on the global climate change, air quality, and noise pollution. As part of my work, I am currently analyzing the costs and benefits of aviation emissions as they relate to man-made climate change.

Carbon dioxide emissions are widely known to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change, however, even though aviation only contributes 2% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, aviation contributes to approximately 5% of global warming. The additional climate impact is caused by a number of non-carbon dioxide high altitude emissions such as such as soot, sulfates, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and notably, contrails, which are artificial clouds that transiently form in the wake of the aircraft.

Quantifying and modeling the current and future climate impacts are associated with uncertainty. My research focuses on improving the quantification of aviation’s impact on climate change, while also making the current research available to policy makers.

Colin Chaney,"I am passionate about engineering solutions for complex problems facing society today. My experience, so far, has been broad so that I may be able to guide teams as a system integrator. As a junior, I hope to delve more into the technicalities of digital and analog systems. Currently I plan  to concentrate in Circuits for my graduate education so that I have an extremely advantageous understanding of how systems work at their base. In my spare time I like to build things or research new advances in technical fields.I have had diverse job experiences working in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Florida. I hope to expand this list more and seeing what other parts of the United States are like, as well as other countries. ","Teaching Assistant

In October 2012, I started work with Dr. Fengyuan Yang in the Center for Emergent Materials at Ohio State. The long-term purpose of this research was to create a GaAs nanowire (NW) infrared LED to be used in spintronics research. The NWs were grown via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. 
Over the course of my two years with the group, I worked on several different aspects of NW characterization and analysis. The first project I worked on was imaging and analyzing samples via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). I measured NW length and taper, determining temperature dependence of both. 
After that project, I developed sample prep protocol for conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM). This involved mechanical polishing and ion milling on nanometer scales. In addition, I was responsible for characterization via c-AFM measurements. The goal was to determine conditions under which single NW transport could be measured.

I conducted research in the astrophysics department of Princeton University with postdoc Remy Joseph and Prof. Peter Melchior. We aimed to model the intrinsic variability, microlensing, reverberation mapping, and determine the time delay associated with gravitationally-lensed quasar light curves. Time delay measurements allow us to constrain various cosmological parameters of our universe such as the Hubble constant. By using light curves that are approximately free from microlensing, we can greatly reduce the uncertainty of the measurement. Using data from the COSMOGRAIL collaboration, I made realistic simulations of time-delayed quasar light curves and designed an algorithm that untangles microlensing effects from the intrinsic variability of the quasar. To achieve this, I used a combination of interpolation, minimization, and regularization methods such as gradient descent, total variation, linear optimization, wavelet transform, and component separation. I borrowed concepts from signal processing and other engineering domains and applied them to our astronomical data. I used Python for my algorithm and collaborated with my advisor using Github. We plan to improve our work through machine learning techniques to enhance our regularization methods by learning the morphology of these signals from real and simulated data. I presented this research in the 235th AAS Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii on January 7, 2020.

At the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), we attempted to uncover the social meaning of code switching in bilingual English and Swahili speakers. The hand-annotated dataset containing English and Swahili text from Twitter and Facebook. We hypothesized that we could uncover social patterns for different demographics based on the code-switching. For instance, we expected to see young people who may be less trusting of local and foreign government switch to Swahili when speaking about politics. We also expected that topics like sports and pop culture would be in English. With military and other government figures abroad, understanding the social context of code-switching can help bridge an important cultural gap. This work is still on-going at ARL.

I was selected to participate in the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP) which provides graduate-level research opportunities for 40 undergraduates nationwide in labs at both MIT and Harvard. In the Kreiman lab at Harvard University, I investigated how to quantify and predict humans' memory of episodic events. I worked independently under the mentorship of a graduate student. Our project had two key components. First, I recruited and ran participants in our study where they watched an episode from a TV series. They returned four times over the next month, during which we recorded their ability to remember clips from the episode. Second, I built machine learning models to predict the participants' recall. The project was interdisciplinary, using psychophysics, machine learning, and cognitive science.

At  Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I worked in natural language processing the summer after my sophomore year. I wanted to predict the gang affiliations of members in an online forum, HoodUp. My method of doing so relied on analyzing gang members' use of code-switching, the use of multiple languages in conversation. One novelty of this project was studying code-switching between English and slang instead of between different languages. We hypothesized that members of different gangs subconsciously switched between English and slang at different times. Under the guidance of a CMU graduate student, we extracted data, including members' posts and self-identified gang affiliation, and I worked on building computational models to predict their affiliation.

We study the molecular mechanisms during development in our model organism of Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, during development there is an abundance of the protein modifier, Small Ubiquitin-related modifier(SUMO), which is a poorly understood protein. The aim of my research has been to incorporate many biochemical and genetic techniques to understand the SUMO proteome in development and how it modulates many molecular networks during embryogenesis.

Diseases such as cancer and diabetes are often linked to unregulated signaling as a result of unregulated nutrients and stress sensors. The post-translation modification (PTM) and nutrient sensor, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), modifies >3,000 proteins and is a key PTM that coordinates cellular responses determining cellular fate. O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) is the essential enzyme solely responsible for the addition of O-GlcNAc on proteins, but how OGT select its proteins to modify under certain stimuli is unknown. I used protein engineering via nanobodies to induce proximity interactions between OGT and an essential PTM protein known as Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier (SUMO).

I found that OGT localization changes with proximity induced SUMOylation and during heat shock OGT relocalizes back to normal cellular compartments. I also analyzed the O-GlcNAc proteome under heat stress using isotope targeted glycoproteomics and found an increase of nuclear proteins and identified target proteins that are both modified by O-GlcNAc and SUMO under heat stress. Crosstalk between SUMO and O-GlcNAc modifications has not been established but these PTMs could concatenate to regulate cellular activity during specific stimuli.
The final layer of biological regulation is through a complex network of molecular signals relayed by chemical modifications on proteins, which influence how proteins interact with each other and function. Understanding the code relayed by these...

I am currently an analytical biochemist on a collaborative project between Harvard University and MIT, studying novel biomarkers of DNA damage to track aging & associated pathologies (cardiovascular, neurological & immunity disorders).
◦ I lead several concurrent projects, collaborating with different laboratories across the Harvard and MIT campuses to identify aging-related DNA modifications in rodent models and human tissues.
◦ I use a range of analytical chemistry instruments to quantify known DNA modifications and identify new ones, such as liquid chromatography (LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
◦ I design and manage experiments to study both animal models and human subjects, am experienced in maintaining analytical instruments and in the use of statistical approaches to interpret data.
◦ Teamwork is central to my daily work, and student supervision (Bachelor, Masters & PhD.) a key element.
◦ I have published papers in a range of international, peer-reviewed journals (Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, Exp. Gerontology, Diabetes Metabolism Research & Reviews, Frontiers in Microbiology, Chem. Soc. Rev.), and presented widely in a range of both invited and congressional settings.

Effect of a Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 on glycation and metabolic disorders in a diabetic context.

The double goal of this thesis was to compare different rodent models of glycation in a type 2 diabetes context (genetic and dietary-induced obesity (DIO) models), and then to use the most pertinent model to study the effects of a specific bacterial strain, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, on glycation and metabolic disorders in this diabetic context. The ensemble of glycation products measured, namely furosine, free and protein-bound carboxymethyllysine (CML) in organs and in plasma, were performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).
Firstly, we showed that the genetic LepRdb/db model exhibited significantly greater glycation in tested organs and fluids (kidneys, lungs, heart, liver and plasma) compared with DIO models (High Fat and High Fat High Sucrose Diet) which, despite dietary-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance, showed no significant increase in furosine or CML levels. Secondly, using the genetic model of diabetes, we showed that a treatment with ME-3 over three months in wild-type mice (LepRdb/+) and LepRdb/db had beneficial effects upon weight gain and glucose tolerance. We also observed a reduction of furosine levels in kidneys and a reduction of free CML in both the kidneys and the lungs. This preclinical study observed other effects of the ME-3 strain on health. Among these, the most marked was a reduction in development of hepatic steatosis.
To conclude, this work has characterized a rodent model of type 2 diabetes for the study of glycation and future development of therapeutic strategies against glycation. It has also highlighted the beneficial effects of the ME-3 strain on both glycation and metabolic disorders in a type 2 diabetes model.

Project: Chemical transformation of nanoparticles for energy applications

Currently conducting senior thesis on the anion-exchange of spinel manganese oxides with sulfur to create metastable manganese oxysulfides with various oxygen to sulfur ratios. These materials have potential applications cheaper alternatives to expensive, rare metals for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This study will also help with getting a fundamental understanding for metastable materials.

Previously worked on the cation-exchange of ternary transition metal oxides for use in supercapacitors. Cation-exchange is a post-synthesis technique that has the potential to control the cation distribution within the lattice, which has a large impact on the conductivity of the material. Received $2100 from Engineering Learning Initiatives Student Grant to conduct this research. 

•	Synthesized transition metal oxide nanoparticles using hot-injection and thermal decomposition methods
•	Calculated thermodynamics of reactions to find optimal conditions and reagents
•	Investigated methods to chemically transform nanoparticles through cation and anion-exchange for various energy applications

Here, I am working on understanding pain points in domestic water-usage and sanitation systems in Indian villages. Addressing people-centric problems often hinges on changing how people think and act. I approach that challenge both through making tangible things and through translating big, seemingly intangible problem statements into technical requirements. Going forward, I’m looking for new ways to apply my systems-level, user-centric thinking and my design and manufacturing skills to problems at the intersection of societal behavior and natural resources, such as sustainable agriculture and material waste reduction.To see more of my projects, visit my personal site at: www.donlonisland.com","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
