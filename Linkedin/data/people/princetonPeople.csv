Mick Upchurch,"I am a Politics major at Princeton University seeking an internship in sales in the financial services industry for the summer of 2022. Due to COVID-19, I decided to take a gap-year: In doing so, I worked full-time as a business development intern with NeuLife Rehab in Mount Dora, FL. During my time at NeuLife, I was a valued member of the sales team that facilitated the increase of patient intake within the facility by over 30%. Besides developing a high proficiency in all Microsoft applications, especially Excel, I took initiative to take on growth-minded independent projects. Most memorably, I orchestrated the expansion and development of the company’s network of lawyers throughout the Southeast. I took further responsibility by managing and updating NeuLife’s CRM platform for over 200 clients, expanding my administrative and Excel know-how. I’m outgoing, driven, and always looking to improve my abilities. If you’d like to get in touch with me, please connect with me here on LinkedIn or email me at upchurch@princeton.edu.","Business Development Intern

My college roommate at Princeton, the indie artist Julien Chang, was in need of a manager when his relationship with his prior manager broke down. So I manage, now, in the interim. I petition his record label, am in touch with other musicians, and am learning about the music industry in perhaps the most exotic way possible.

CoffeeBreak
Jan 2016 - Jun 2018 · 2 yrs 6 mos
CoffeeBreak was an app to simplify meeting others with similar interests in real life I decided to start as a 15 year old - a few friends and I hacked away at it for a few years. The slogan on the website used to be: ""Meet and Eat. Making new friends and connections has never been so easy."" What we discovered was that we were, to each other, interesting people to talk to (making the initial circumstance for its inception null). Very simply, we were attempting to create an overly complicated tool that would allow person A to match with person B based off of context and interest, at a local coffee shop or restaurant. We naturally jumped the gun, so to speak. We had too many inputs, our tool sucked, and we had the imaginations of high schoolers. But it was an exciting journey nonetheless, and led me to think about social tools and how they can be used effectively (and where they fail) at a very early age.
Website has, unfortunately, been down for a few years.

Annie Akbar,"I'm a first-year student at Princeton University majoring in Politics with a field concentration in American Politics. I am planning to go to law school after I graduate and one day become a civil rights lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.My experience as a low-income woman of color in America has inspired my interest in civil rights law and has spurred me to engage in organizations like MyVote Project that raise awareness about social issues, such as reproductive rights and immigration policies. In order to introduce myself to the law field, I did freelance work with Rankin & Gregory Injury Law, which included researching common personal injury situations. This further increased my love for law, specifically fighting for those who have been wronged in any way.By studying Politics at Princeton University so far, I have learned more about the thought processes that support the major institutions in our country, such as those behind the legal system. I hope that this knowledge will aid me in providing the best legal counsel to all people.","Freelance

In 2019-20, I successfully renewed multiple grants previously awarded to JPA, amounting to approximately $600,000, including increasing some grant amounts by 10-15% after years of flat awards. 2.	In 2019-2020 I researched and successfully applied to at least five new foundations, increasing revenue to JPA by $148,500.3.	During this time, I researched, applied to and/or established connections with 19 foundations (including a major State of Illinois opportunity) new to JPA that have potential for future grant funding of an estimated $1.5 million.4.	I wrote and edited over 20 grant reports as needed to maintain JPA’s status with each foundation listed above as well as contributing to reports for major grants such as Fry, Polk Bros., and Crown, supporting over $1.5 million in grants5.	I also wrote and edited extensively for the organization, including for major grant applications, and wrote and edited monthly issues of the JPA newsletter before coming on board full-time on 1/1/2019.6.	Contributed major written content for new JPA website, including learning and applying online editing tools. 7.	Devised and began the development of JPA’s Summer Institute for teachers8.	In 2019, I assisted the former Director of Development in researching and developing foundation and corporate contacts, including beginning to establish a significant partnership with the St. Jane Hotel in downtown Chicago.9.	In 2019-20, I implemented an online grant management platform that consolidated all of JPA’s grant providers, deadlines, documents, results, and more into one clear and highly usable format. (Previously, grant data had been stored on different Excel documents, making organization and tracking extremely difficult.) It is cost-efficient and also provides direct access to grant research opportunities, reminders to multiple individuals, and document storage for each grantmaker. College advising:I have helped hundreds of high schools students and their families define their priorities, research, and apply to colleges that were appropriate fits. I help with essays and assure that applications are completed in a timely manner. The majority of those students were accepted to one or more of their top three-five choices. I use a very one-to-one process that puts the student first and helps him/her consider personal as well as academic issues in the process.",,,,,,

My work examined how the FTA could better support businesses in Vietnam and what would be required of the government to promote these outcomes. I delivered weekly briefs to the chief economist, which by definition had to be detailed and highly actionable in nature. The recommendations I provided were then shared with representatives from the Vietnamese trade bureau.

I also preformed additional business development tasks such as reviewing and updating informational pamphlets intended for partner outreach.

We initially sought to reduce tensions between young people and police officers by creating and disseminating training modules that provide police departments with the youth point-of-view on crucial issues. Our training curriculum was released to all 1000 officers of the Portland Police Bureau in early 2020. Raising Justice also focused on reducing other inputs to system involvement by championing policy reform and mobilizing youth advocacy. Raised over $50,000 with team of 10+ directors and officers nationally.

Students came from a wide range of schools, especially those without access to formal, school-based journalism programming.
Everyone says journalism is dying. That it is unimportant. That there is no longer any reason for young people to do it. The reality is, anyone who says that is wrong. This summer, for the fourth year in a row, I am working in conjunction with...

I personally spoke to Election Officials from 20 counties in 5 states across the country to gather historical context, financial data, and process advice on the proposed bill. I turned this research (and information from a general online literature review) into a policy paper for the organization to use for lobbying efforts. The bill was successfully passed.

Infosys · Internship
Jun 2020 - Aug 2020 · 3 mos
Under iCETS, Infosys Center for Emerging Technology Solutions, I am learning about quantum algorithms and their applications. Quantum algorithms seek to capitalize on the advantages of quantum computers, a field that is quite novel. So, using Python, IBMQ, and Qiskit, I am exploring these algorithms to understand the benefits of the quantum space. This exploration involves understanding the math behind these algorithms and their implementations in Qiskit. The culmination of my learning will be a showcase of a few applications of quantum algorithms in areas such as the distribution of goods to clients and RSA encryption, both of which are applications that can be employed in the future as quantum computers become more powerful.
Quantum Computing
Solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently is a major stake in the industry. Thanks to the power of quantum computing, it is nowadays possible to prepare, with implementation on small datasets, the quantum machine learning algorithms that will solve these problems for the next generations of quantum computers.

I am working under Princeton Prof. Adam Finkelstein to research a specific segment in the history of voicemail. Specifically, we are aiming to recover sound from sonorines, cards from the 1900s with audio recorded onto them. As the devices used to record onto these cards are obsolete, we are seeking to recover the sound using techniques in math and computer science. This involves using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to solve systems of equations to calculate normal and height maps using sparse matrices and least squares approximations.

I am the president of an outreach program of hundreds of high school students nationwide who are engaged in computational biology research and fundraising for disease research. 

In my research, I've invested the link between gene expression and multifactorial diseases like pancreatic cancer, opioid addiction, and COVID-19. I have presented abstracts of my research at the annual Genes in Diseases and Symptoms (GIDAS) Research Conference and have received awards for the best poster.

During the summer of 2020, I served as a group leader for miRcore's Computational Biology, and also served as a group leader for the Biotechnology Sequencing camp in the summer of 2021.

I worked with Buzz Online to develop a 6-week virtual course for middle schoolers on using online databases to investigate cancer mutations, and a virtual workshop on the same topic.

Currently, I am serving as one of the social media committee chairs for Vaccine Advocacy Initiative. In this role, I have developed our weekly newsletter and coordinated with committee members to develop promotional materials.

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center · Internship

During this internship at the Ocean Ecology Laboratory, I wrote a research paper titled “Measuring Phytoplankton: Understanding Arctic Dwellers.” The purpose of the paper is to compare phytoplankton size groups derived from algorithm data (Uitz and Ciotti) to actual data (in situ pigments and
carbon percentages), while discussing potential issues leading to error between such data. Previously in the summer I presented my findings in a research poster at the summer intern poster session to different NASA employees. During the internship itself, I prepared phytoplankton/algae samples daily and ran them in a spectrophotometer for analysis of aquatic organisms, reinforced lab practices by thoroughly cleaning lab equipment with diluted HCL and RBS-35, and practiced laboratory cleaning
procedures to minimize measurement errors. After data collection, I analyzed the samples' absorbance spectra and pigment data (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and compared to standards to identify phytoplankton species.

My experience working with data on big and small scales has allowed me to learn to appreciate and analyze both the big picture and the small details. My time spent living in India and Armenia left me with a global lens and a desire to work with and learn from people around the world and I believe the lessons I learned in cultural communication and collaboration serve me in everything I do. Whether it’s in the classroom, in my work beyond school, or even solving a jigsaw puzzle, I love connecting dots and finding solutions.I am a strong believer in learning through experience, adapting quickly, and maximizing opportunity. When the COVID-19 Pandemic hit and my university transitioned to online classes, I chose to take a leave from school and pursue experiences outside of the classroom for the second time.

Diego Solorio,"Astrophysics. As the toddler who created water vortexes with the salad spinner instead of playing with actual toys, understanding the underlying mechanics of the universe always dominated my heart.  Besides being involved in STEM clubs such as MESA or Quiz Bowl during my high school career, I pushed beyond what was offered to pursue my passion and was accepted into two astrophysics summer programs: UCI’s COSMOS and UC Berkeley’s ATDP, eye-opening programs that further fueled my fire for physics.  I also had the unbelievable opportunity to intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I worked on an astrophysics-based computer science project, which remains disclosed.  My heart and soul are all in for astrophysics.Other than my passion for the science field, I am a leader.  Formerly, I was a shy turtle who had nightmares about group work and presentations.  I have since realized that a true scientist would need to be able to communicate their findings effectively and work well with groups.  Over lots of blood sweat and tears, I have been able to metamorphosis into a social butterfly!  I was elected as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 4 West Key Club, where I ran a 27-person board and gave speeches and hosted service events on the regular.  Through Key Club and ASB, I have experience in leading and working with groups as a benevolent and encouraging voice.",,"Princeton University

Bazaar is a leading Android marketplace in Iran, developed by Avaye Hamrahe Hooshmande Hezardastan and owned by Hezardastan Information Technology Development Group.
 I joined this company for the summer internship and started to work with the fraud detection group. They tried to detect malicious behaviors in the apps before publishing them on the marketplace. One specific concern was the time that an application ask for some permissions but exploit them in a malicious way. For example, they get permission to read texts in order to autofill the verification codes, but they end reading user text messages for some other purposes. We needed to modify the Android OS in order to better track and identify this malicious activities and for doing so we ended up with a customized version of Android OS which was used on our test devices to identify these behaviors.",,,,,

- Presented as winners out of over 40 teams and 240+ competitors from around the world
- Built a project called ShopWhole, a service that would allow college students to purchase goods at normal quantities at wholesale prices. We used a regression algorithm to predict the order size of a particular good on a given college campus using previous purchasing trends. By ordering this quantity from a manufacturer, we could bring our clients their needs in manageable quantities and for manageable prices.
Fourth Place in National Mathworks Math Modeling Competition
Issued by SIAM and Jane Street · May 2020
- Twenty-page research paper written in fourteen hours earned fourth place out of 760 others from across the nation
- Judged by a panel of professional mathematicians on our mathematical methods(Monte Carlo, multiple regression, featured scaling, etc)
- Results were read by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency(NACFE) and shared with researchers from leading trucking companies 
- Modeled the growth of the electric trucking industry in regards to both the trucks and the infrastructure to maintain them. Found that the greatest limiting factor will be the charging speed and capacity of lithium ion batteries. Given current trends in battery improvements, legislation, social consciousness around electric-solutions, and electric trucking adoption rates, we predicted that charging stations will have to be placed roughly every 100 miles along major trucking corridors and that electric trucks will vastly outnumber diesel trucks in the long and regional haul trucking industry.

As the AD of Content, I was tasked with restructuring and negotiating a ~$50K contract with one of the IC's official sponsors, the Wall Street Journal, and managing the Writing Competition, our annual business journalism contest. As part of the Marketing team, I am also responsible for sharing content on our social media channels, creating marketing emails, and sourcing 200+ contacts for global outreach, including in Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America. 

To facilitate the online transition, I have helped to curate digital content and network with other ADs and conducted independent outreach for executives, recently securing a keynote speech with the Global Head of Partnership Strategy & Operations at Twitter.

As a Specialist Department Administrator, I was the public-facing representative of the department within the company. I created a seamless experience for every transacting client, many of whom were unfamiliar with auction procedures. I managed the pre-sale logistics in SAP for three auctions annually (500+ lots of paintings, drawings, and sculptures). As the Assistant to a Senior Vice President, I maintained her correspondence, calendar, expense reports, and domestic and international travel arrangements. I also trained and oversaw the department’s annual rotations of 4+ interns and floaters.

In this role, I was trained to safely handle paintings, drawings, and sculpture, catalogued fine art, and participated in conceptualizing exhibition installations. I interviewed clients to determine the provenance of works of art, performed catalogue raisonné research, and liaised with international 19th century experts to authenticate works for auction.

Evidence of Trade Deflection: Investigating the Impact of U.S. Antidumping on E.U. Imports
Based on Bown & Crowley (2007), we investigate the existence and magnitude of a deflection effect of US trade barriers on EU imports in a context of heightened uncertainty in global trade. Using dynamic panel data, we assess the impact of changes in US trade defence policy against third country exporters on the volume of EU imports using antidumping data from Bown (2015). We find evidence of a significant 8-22% increase on average in the volume of EU imports of targeted goods.","Volonteer

One-Shot Learning using RRAM-Based Associative Memory

Real-time learning from a few examples (one/few-shot learning) is a key challenge for machine learning systems today. When never-seen-before data is encountered, conventional parametric models like DNNs need to re-learn their parameters via gradient-based learning, often requiring huge amount of data coupled with slow learning iterations. Non-parametric models (like nearest neighbours) do not require any training, but have lower accuracy. Recent research has combined the two to create “memory-augmented” neural networks (MANNs) that can rapidly learn new examples while still performing well on common examples. MANNs consist of a frontend, which is a traditional CNN or RNN, that extracts features from new classes, and a backend associative memory that stores a hashed version of these features. During learning, new features are stored in the memory, and during inference, the feature computed on input data is compared with all the features stored in the memory, and the closest match determines the classification result. This work implements an associative memory with an RRAM-based content addressable memory for area-efficient feature storage and fast feature matching.

William Coulton,"Since 2013 I have been a graduate student at Princeton University studying cosmology, where my research is focused on the interface between theory and data. In particular, I develop physical models and statistical tools to compare them with data.  I have primarily worked on modelling and measuring non-Gaussian signals in the cosmic microwave background. In addition, I have worked on modeling distortions in the HSC CCDs.During these projects I have become involved with two collaborations: the Hyper-suprime camera collaboration, focused on an optical camera on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration, a microwave telescope in Chile. My experience in these collaborations has helped me grow as team player and developed my technical communications skills.Through my research I have developed strong python skills as well as a working knowledge of C++ and Fortran. My research particularly benefited from my knowledge of high performance computing. In parallel to my research, I have furthered my interest in machine learning methods.","Graduate Student

I received my Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton in 2009, and was a professor at UC Berkeley for 12 years.My primary research interests are in decision, game, and rational choice theory. My book Risk and Rationality (Oxford University Press, 2013) concerns how an individual ought to take risk into account when making decisions. It vindicates the ordinary decision-maker from the point of view of even ideal rationality. I also have research interests in the philosophy of religion and in epistemology. Some topics I have written on include the relationship between assigning probability to a hypothesis and believing that hypothesis outright; the conditions under which one ought to stop looking for more evidence and make a decision; when and why social equality matters; and the nature of faith, both in the religious and the more mundane sense.Website: www.larabuchak.net","Professor (Department of Philosophy)

I'm a graduate student in the Shaevitz lab. I'm interested in understanding the physical properties of the different components of the bacterial cell (cytoplasm, nucleoid, etc), and how these characteristics affect the internal mechanisms and processes of cells. To achieve this goal I image fluorescently labeled probes using a custom built biplane microscope. From these images I am able to extract 3D trajectories and use these to study diffusion processes that provide information about the relevant physics in the cell.

I interned with Dr. Richard Steiner on the Electronic Kilogram project.  The Electronic Kilogram project research centered around the Watt Balance.  The Watt Balance is a super precise and accurate weighing machine which exactly offsets the force of gravity pulling on an object by a force produced when an electrical current is run through a coil of wire in a magnetic field.  The Watt Balance provides a basis for a new definition of the base quantity mass, based on invariant quantum properties of nature.  The kilogram is the only SI unit that is still defined by an artifact (a platinum iridium mass which is unfortunately unstable).

My role was to measure the gravitational acceleration constant in the immediate area around the Watt Balance (which was in the process of moving to a new building), and assembling a map based on my measurements of the gravitational field.  In doing so, I had to correct for many phenomenon, such as the tides and building vibrations.

Camila Llerena-Olivera,"Hello! My name is Camila. I am a PhD candidate in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Princeton University. I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Environmental and Ecological Engineering at Purdue University. My diverse experience in environmental research has given me a multidimensional perspective on issues such as water quality, social sustainability, biorenewable energy, and waste reduction.

The Arequipa Nexus Institute is a collaborative effort between Purdue University and the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín (UNSA) in Arequipa, Peru for the development of a food, water, energy, and environment research program in Arequipa. I have a personal connection to this project since most of my family in my paternal side lives in Arequipa. In June 2018, a group of professors from UNSA visited the U.S. to attend the Borlaug Summer Institute, a lecture series set by the Purdue Center for Global Food Security. Over the course of this brief summer program, I translated conversations, PowerPoint presentations, and essays between UNSA and Purdue professors. These conversations were crucial in setting up the initial timelines for the research of these projects. In the later months, I would translate documents related to sustainable watershed research from English to Spanish.

A graduate student advised by Dr. John Sutherland (Environmental Engineering) needed assistance on his project related to social sustainability. This field of research is related to understanding how sustainability in the workplace can promote the overall well-being of stakeholders.  Three sets of surveys were given to people associated with anonymous companies. Each survey had questions related to the basic, safety, affiliation, esteem, and actualization needs that the stakeholder groups could deem necessary. The necessity of each need was scaled from 1-5, with 1 being not important and 5 being very important. My task for this month-long project was to create 30 tables from these sets of questions. The tables improved the organization of these questions and presentation of the student's paper.

Under the guidance of Dr. Michael Harris (Chemical Engineering), I investigated how well the station worked compared to other expensive stations on the market. The experiment included the following work: revising the initial procedure, preparing standards of cellulose powder with varying moisture contents, recording data from the standards with vnaJ software, graphing results with MATLAB, and analyzing electrical parameter shifts. During the first three weeks of my research, I also supervised a high school intern participating in this project.

Senior design is a capstone project required for undergraduates in Environmental and Ecological Engineering. Each team is partnered with a company to solve an environmental problem. My team was partnered with Cook Research Incorporated (CRI), a subsidiary of the medical device company Cook Medical. The purpose of this project was to to characterize the waste streams of the CRI building and to propose a plan to improve their current recycling system. To accomplish this task, the team submitted a waste sampling plan to the president of CRI, sampled 1/3 of the waste in the recycling/non-recycling dumpsters by weight at various days, and presented the results to CRI employees at a monthly company meeting.
Identification of Waste Streams at Cook Research Incorporated to Decrease Overall Waste
The goal for students is to decrease the overall landfill waste and identify areas where recycling or reuse could be more effective. Additionally, there are five other Cook companies in West Lafayette who could incorporate waste stream changes, making the overall impact much larger than a single company.

As the company began hiring full-time developers, I shifted to a software development role reporting directly to the Director of Software Engineering. This mostly involved our collaboration on functional proof-of-concepts for new features in the core Kahuna application. I built Gitlab CICD pipelines, managed and wrote software for internal Kubernetes clusters, wrote documentation, and spearheaded new features like Moku, Kahuna's MS Teams chatbot. Simultaneously I advised newer interns on the technical aspects of their roles.

I worked alongside Professor Joel Ager and Shaoni Kar (currently a PhD student at NTU) on a topic concerning optical engineering. Essentially, I used computer simulations in order to give recommendations about how laser device structure could be improved.

I used different models and simulations in order to determine parameters of a distributed Bragg reflector. This DBR could then be inserted into a laser in order to increase the efficiency of light emission (previous literature indicate that light emission increases as much as 8 fold with the presence of a DBR).

Center for Plasma Material Interactions
Currently I am setting up a schlieren imaging system to characterize an atmospheric plasma jet used for industrial cleaning and activation of metallic surfaces. Schlieren is a powerful diagnostic that allows imaging of density variations in a refractive medium.

During my junior year (Fall 2016 - Spring 2017), I investigated the feasibility and engineering parameters of small compact toroid devices with computational and mathematical methods, under the guidance of Professor Davide Curreli. Specifically, I am exploring spheromaks with extremely compact geometries, tending towards a flux conserver radius of roughly 5 cm. 

In terms of hands on experience with fusion research, my work at the Center for Plasma Material Interactions (CPMI), under the guidance of Professor David Ruzic and Professor Daniel Andruczyk, has given me valuable practical knowledge in the design of laboratory plasma experiments. I have worked on the setup and data acquisition of several projects at CPMI, including the Hybrid Illinois Device for Research Applications (HIDRA), and the DEVeX theta pinch device. With the HIDRA fusion device, I have helped install the electrical and cooling systems so that the device can commence experiments on flowing liquid lithium plasma facing components (PFCs). I have also prepared a 6kW magnetron heating source for plasma heating experiments in HIDRA. With DEVeX, over this past summer I worked with a visiting scientist from Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL) to study a novel plasma facing component (porous Moly wetted with Lithium) in the presence of a plasma instability. This type of PFC will be studied further at PPPL in NSTX-U, the National Spherical Tokamak Experiment.","Princeton University

Reinforcement Learning (RL)
1. Develop a constrained RL algorithm that optimizes rewards while satisfying safety constraints with statistical learning bounds for the worst-case constraint violations.
2. Improve sample-efficiency of an RL algorithm by incorporating baseline policies from prior applications.
3. Deploy the constrained RL algorithm in real-world applications ranging from controlling a traffic flow, planning safe trajectories for autonomous vehicles, and safely learning from human demonstrations.
4. Execute the proposed algorithm, which achieves up to 10 times faster learning efficiency while ensuring safety constraint satisfaction during learning.
5. Integrate deep learning models with physics priors to improve the sample efficiency of the model.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
1. Develop a learning algorithm and computational model to learn a control policy for instruction-following tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
2. Propose a model that uses natural language to specify a set of constraints observed by robotic systems.
3. Collaborate with other researchers to construct a new large-scaled navigation dataset with free-form text to benchmark models.

I am a graduate student in Professor John Groves' lab at the Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, where I am studying the heme protein indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). IDO1 is a key enzyme involved in immune escape, and with my work, I hope to better elucidate the mechanistic steps in its catalytic cycle. Before moving to the Groves lab in 2018, I was in Professor Nozomi Ando's lab, where I used x-ray crystallography to identify an important regulatory mechanism used by the enzyme BchL involved in the rate-limiting step of chlorophyll biosynthesis.

Collaborated with other researchers in aligning optics to demonstrate the optical spring effect without using an optical cavity. The effect was shown through the interference created at a GaAs microresonator, a beam splitter. Analytically calculated the spring constant of the microresonator. Our theoretical results (created using Mathematica and MATLAB) predicted the experimental results of the effect of changing the laser power on the frequency shift of the optical spring.
Worked in collaboration with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Our results could increase the sensitivity of LIGO.

Course Taught (Assistant in Instruction): Archaic and Classical Greece
The social, political, and cultural history of ancient Greece from ca.750 B.C. through the time of the Peloponnesian War (404 B.C.). Special attention is paid to the emergence of the distinctively Greek form of political organization, the city state, and to democracy, imperialism, social practices, and cultural developments. Emphasis is placed on study of the ancient sources, methods of source analysis, and historical reasoning.
Course Taught (Assistant in Instruction): Citizenships Ancient and Modern
Recent developments in the United States and throughout the world have exposed fault lines in how communities design and regulate forms of citizenship. But current debates over the assignment, withholding, or deprivation of citizen status have a long, violent history. In this course we attempt to map a history of citizenship from the ancient Mediterranean world to the 21st century.

I was able to experience firsthand how debilitating the virus was for my community, which is mostly composed of Hispanic and low-income families. Although I had already decided to major in Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE), I was unsure of which of the six CBE concentrations I would pursue. Living through a pandemic and seeing how the whole world was affected inspired me to choose to concentrate on Bioengineering and Biotechnology.During my junior year, I took two courses that really drove my interest in drug development: Molecular and Cellular Immunology and Antibiotics: From Cradle to Grave. Through taking Molecular and Cellular Immunology, I learned about how the immune system responds and provides a defense mechanism against microorganisms using cellular and molecular mechanisms, and how understanding these mechanisms is critical in the development of vaccines and forms of immunotherapy, especially during the development of COVID-19 vaccines. As this course taught the very technical sides of immunology, Antibiotics: From Cradle to Grave taught me how science, engineering, medicine, and policy have shaped the current age of antibiotics. We went from discussing the development of antibiotics and the benefits that they brought to the world to how the overuse of them both in humans and animals is driving the promotion of antibiotic resistance. These two courses really drove my interest in drug development and inspired my senior thesis topic. During my senior year, I joined the Link Lab, where I worked on my thesis research, focusing on the stability and activity of a novel lasso peptides research, which is important to study given their wide variety of biological functions, such as their antimicrobial and antiviral activity, anti-HIV activity, receptor antagonism activity, and enzyme inhibition activity.As the pandemic persists, I desire to pursue opportunities in bioengineering and biotechnology that will allow me to contribute to the efforts currently being made to develop treatments for illnesses that affect millions of people across the world.","Undergraduate Thesis Researcher
